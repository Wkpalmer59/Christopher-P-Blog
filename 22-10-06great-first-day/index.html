<h1>Great First Day</h1>
<p>Ian is finally out of here and we got our window to head south. My first mate is staying home to help our oldest prepare for her wedding and our friend Kevin graciously agreed to stand in.</p>
<p>We had picture perfect weather for our trip from Milford to Atlantic City and our forecast for tomorrow looks great for us to get to Norfolk and mile 0 of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.</p>
<p>Our destination for this leg is Myrtle Beach where I will leave the boat until after the wedding.</p>
<p>Here are some pics from today. You couldn&#39;t ask for calmer seas on the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Lady Liberty, Verrazano Narrows Bridge, Atlantic City Entrance, Kevin and Bill in AC</p>
