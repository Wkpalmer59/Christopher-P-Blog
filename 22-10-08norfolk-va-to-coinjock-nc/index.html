<p>Short day today, just 50 miles. Passed the ship yards on the way and caught this aircraft carrier in dry dock. Then went through the Great Bridge lock and tied up in Coinjock at 3pm. Got a little windy so we are glad we got our off shore runs out of the way. Fridge iced up on us, so we are dealing with food in insulated bags while we thaw it out. Has happened once before, so I know how to deal with it. Shouldn&#39;t lose any food.</p>
<p>Prime ribs are reserved in the restaurant for this evening. Yum!</p>
