<p>Did 85 waterway miles today. 47 degrees when we got up this morning (are we headed south?). Turned out to be a beautiful sunny calm day, As you may, or may not, know the waterway is comprised of a series of natural bodies of water that are connected by man made canals. Today we traversed the Alligator River-Pungo River canal that connects, yes you guessed it, the Alligator river and Pungo river (couldn&#39;t they come up with a better name? AlliPun? Just saying).</p>
<p>It goes for 10 miles, takes a slight turn and then goes for another 10 miles (see pic), amazing engineering feat.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we head for Beaufort NC.</p>
