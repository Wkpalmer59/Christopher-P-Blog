<h1>Short Day to Beaufort NC</h1>

<p>Shoved off at 7:15am and caught this beautiful sunrise.</p>
<p>Had an easy day in the Pungo, Bay and Nuese rivers and got into Beaufort Docks at around 2:30pm. Had a little drama getting into the slip. Got caught in the current and almost added some new scratches to the Christopher P, but was able to recover and get her into the slip. Bow thruster earned its keep today. :-)</p>
<p>Another easy day tomorrow down to Harbor Village and then Myrtle Beach on Wednesday where will leave the boat until after the wedding.</p>
