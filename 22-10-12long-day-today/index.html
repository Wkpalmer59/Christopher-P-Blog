<p>For the last day of this leg of our trip south we left Hampstead at 6:45am and got into Myrtle Beach at 5pm. Weather was good and the trip was uneventful. I will leave the boat here and fly out on Friday. We will return with my sister and brother-in-law on the 23rd after my daughter&#39;s wedding and continue our trip down to Cocoa FL. Check back after the 23rd!</p>
