<p>October 23 – Day 1</p>
<p>Arrived in Myrtle Beach, SC via Avelo Airlines at just after noon to beautiful weather…sunny and in the 70s. We took an Uber to the Barefoot Marina and boarded the Christopher P, dropped our luggage, and headed out to lunch, went to the grocery store and stocked up so we are ready to head out early tomorrow.</p>
<p>We will be traveling the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway for the next two weeks.  We are currently at mile 355 and will be traveling to Cocoa Beach at mile 897 at a leisurely pace (~5-6 hours per day).  You can track our progress on MarineTraffic.com…see the link on the main page.</p>
<p>We will be relaxing, enjoying streaming music and watching the ospreys circling the marina.  I have been relaxing in my corner up on the bridge.</p>

<p>See the picture of our hosts, Captain Bill and Admiral Adrienne…Bill may be the captain, but the Admiral is really in charge.</p>
<p>More tomorrow when we get to Georgetown, SC</p>
