<p>We arose just before 0700 hours went for a brisk 30 min walk, in foggy 52° weather (colder than Milford, CT).  We got underway a bit later than planned due to dense fog – 0935 hours rather than 0830 hours.  We cruised south at a leisurely pace ~10 mph.</p>
<p>We passed under the Socastee swing bridge that had to open for us. We continued south on the Waccamaw River.  Osprey nests were on top of trees and pilings all along the way.  We also spotted dolphins and turtles. Chris claimed to spot an alligator, but his sighting is still suspect.</p>
<p>We arrived in Georgetown, SC (SC’s 3rd oldest city) about 1600 hrs, walked into town and did a bit of tourist shopping.  Came back to the boat for cocktails and then had dinner at the Corner Tavern (see our dinner view above).</p>

<p>We seem to be following a group of party boats that are all decked out for Halloween (see picture).</p>
