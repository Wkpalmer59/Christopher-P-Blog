<h1>October 25, 2022 – Day 3 – Mile 405 to Mile 470</h1>

<p>We arose just before 0700 hours but no walk this morning, instead the Admiral made us English muffin sandwiches with fried eggs, bacon, and cheese.  I had galley clean up duties.</p>
<p>The weather today was partly cloudy in the 70s and luckily no fog.  We got underway at exactly 0830hrs much to the captain’s delight.  We cruised leisurely further south down the waterway.</p>
<p>In Winwah Bay at about mile 408 we passed the spot where the smokestack of the Civil War Union Flagship Harvest Moon (sunk by the confederates) can be spotted at low tide.  Unfortunately for us, it was high tide.</p>
<p>We spotted a couple of bald eagles, a “scavenger” of gulls (we think non-breeding Laughing Gulls), and many other birds.  We were entertained by dolphins playing in our wake thanks to Dolphin Whisperer Captain Bill who has determined that an engine speed of 1800 rpms is the dolphin’s happy speed and if they are not being lazy, they will play in the wake. (see picture)</p>
<p>The scariest part of the day was when Chris briefly took the helm and immediately removed his hands and turned around, luckily Admiral Adrienne was sitting next to him to take over if necessary. (see picture)</p>

<p>We passed through the Isle of Palms where the waterway is lined with mansions and elaborate docks and boats.</p>
<p>As we passed through Charleston Harbor we saw Fort Sumter which is a sea fort built on an artificial island protecting Charleston, South Carolina from naval invasion.  The Battle of Fort Sumter was the beginning of the Civil War.</p>
<p>We finally arrived at the Charleston City Marina about 3:30 PM. Charleston (Chuck Town) is South Carolina’s oldest and busiest port city.  As we have all visited Charleston before we decided to do our walk near the Marina, eat dinner on the boat and just relax.</p>
