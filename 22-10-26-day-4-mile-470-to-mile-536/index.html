<p>We got an early start today at 0745hrs and headed toward Beaufort (BEWfert), SC.  Our weather was partly cloudy in the 70s with occasional gusts of wind.</p>
<p>For the last couple of days, we have been traveling through the Low Country of SC.  The Intracoastal waterway here alternates with tidal marshes and expensive houses. Many of the houses are on stilts to protect from flooding or set back with long docks over the marsh.</p>
<p>This morning we passed through Elliott’s Cut (the narrowest spot in the Intracoastal  Waterway) (see picture) and then through many little rivers and by many islands including Dawho River, Edisto Island and the Ashepoo River just to name a few.  We had many more dolphins today, many of them playing in our wake.</p>
<p>We passed by the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort and F18 hornets were flying overhead.  Captain Bill visited Cousin Kara and Steve here several times. This is where Colonel Steve was stationed in the past.</p>
<p>We arrived in Beaufort at the marina about 1500hrs.  The Safe Harbor marina (formerly the municipal marina) is right on the edge of town with a beautiful park right next to the marina.</p>
<p>We went for a walk through the park and the town and purchased a few souvenirs.</p>
<p>Beaufort is located on Port Royal Island (one of South Carolina’s Sea islands).  It is the second oldest port in SC.  It was occupied by the Union forces during the Civil War and became a haven for escaping slaves…. read more HERE.</p>

<p>We ended the day at Luther&#39;s on the waterfront where the Admiral and I had shrimp burgers while enjoying a beautiful sunset (see picture).</p>
