<h1>October 27, 2022 – Day 5 – Mile 536 to Mile 590</h1>

<p>After a morning walk in the waterfront park, we cast off at 0830hrs.  We cruised down the Beaufort River into Skull Creek, alongside Hilton Head Island, down the Skidaway River and by Skidway Island and Freedom Creek, formerly known as Runaway Negro Creek. We ended our day here at the Isle of Hope.  You can see our course in the picture.</p>
<p>We passed by a tree filled with egrets and a nearby tree had a Great Blue Heron.  There were only a few dolphins today, but they were lazy and didn’t play in our wake.</p>
<p>We have been on the lookout for both Manatees and Alligators as we have seen numerous signs asking us not to feed the alligators and to slow down to protect the manatees.</p>

<p>After arriving here in Isle of Hope (our first port in Georgia) we borrowed the marina loaner car (the right back door didn’t open, no gas cap and it made terrible noises), but it got us to the store for grocery shopping.  We will eat on the boat tonight entertained by the local band playing here at the marina.</p>
