<h1>October 28, 2022 – Day 6 – Mile 590 to Mile 620</h1>

<p>We had a leisurely morning with walks along Bluff St with trees draped in Spanish moss and beautiful homes festooned with spiders, witches, ghosts, and other great Halloween decorations. In addition, one home had a rainbow flag, and another had a sign with Black Lives Matter and Science is Real.  So, I am feeling a bit of hope and decided that was appropriate in Isle of Hope</p>
<p>The captain made us delicious ham and cheese omelets accompanied by English muffins topped with Alyssa’s new father-in-law’s peach jam (a nod to Georgia.)</p>
<p>We went through Ossabaw Sound and passed by Ossabaw Island. Traversed the Vernon River, the Florida passage, and took a 6 mile detour off the Intracoastal up the Medway River to reach the Sunbury Crab Company where we are spending the night.</p>

<p>The Sunbury Crab Company is a new destination for the Captain and Admiral and will probably be a one-time stop.  Although we read great reviews and were looking forward to the fresh caught oysters, shrimp and Blue crabs, it didn’t quite live up to some of our expectations.  The captain and I chose the blue crab (I thought eating Dungeness crabs in the shell was difficult).  We each got 4 small crabs that yielded very little actual meat and would have left hungry except our significant others shared their grilled shrimp.</p>
