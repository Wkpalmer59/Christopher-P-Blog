<p>We cast off early this morning at 0740hrs and traversed the North Newport River to Johnson Creek to South Newport River to Sapelo River to Creighton Narrows to Old Teakettle Creek to North River to the Rockdedundy River and then the Little Mud River through Buttermilk Sound to Mackay River to the Brunswick River (have I lost you yet?) and then docked for the first of two nights at Brunswick Landing Marina.</p>
<p>We passed by a series of islands known as the Golden Isles which include Simons Island, Sea Island, Little St. Simons Island, and Blythe Island.  They are “so named because of their vast marshes that turn a beautiful golden color in the fall.” Unfortunately, it has been cloudy all day and so we didn’t get the full effects of the color.  A much larger group of our ubiquitous laughing gulls were with us again today.  Still no manatee or alligator sightings. Captain Bill spied a Mobula Ray (also known as the devil ray) jump in front of the boat.</p>

<p>We had dinner tonight at the indigo Coastal Shanty and it was great! We all agreed it rated 5 out of 5 stars. We shared an appetizer of Plantain chips, and Admiral Adrienne and I had the SESAME CRUSTED CATFISH...Crisp fillet served with plum miso sauce, spiked tartar &amp; isla slaw over fragrant jasmine rice …the best catfish I ever had! And we all shared the GEORGIA PEACH POUND CAKE… Griddled in butter with scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, Bourbon caramel sauce &amp; spiced pecans…yum!</p>
<p>We are all now ready for bed as we have a busy day in Brunswick tomorrow.</p>
<p>More tomorrow…Guest Blogger Connie</p>
