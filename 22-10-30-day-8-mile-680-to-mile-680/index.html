<p>As we are here in Brunswick for two nights, we spent today doing some chores…laundry, grocery shopping, etc.</p>
<p>This is a very large marina with 250+ slips.  This is a jumping off point for boats headed to the tropics for the winter. They wait out hurricane season here as it is a “hurricane hole” (a protected area located far inland that can avoid surge and winds.)</p>
<p>The marina also seems to have a lot of people here just living on their boats (the nautical equivalent of “Nomad”).  The marina has very nice facilities including, free washers and dryers, a library/game room, free bikes to borrow, etc.</p>
<p>Our goal was to be done with our chores by 2:00 PM for the Brunswick Landing Marina 2022 Oyster Roast which we were very excited to attend. As we had to uber to and from the grocery store, we didn’t arrive until about 2:30 PM. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a disappointment…maybe our expectations were too high?? There was a crowd of people (see picture) enjoying the event when we arrived. There was free beer and wine and plenty of oysters…both steamed and raw, but for the most part you had to shuck your own.  We were unprepared for shucking, Chris of course managed to beg a few raw ones from a nice guy but the rest of us left without any oysters…but we did have our free wine and beer!</p>
<p>We headed back to the boat and relaxed the rest of the afternoon and then had a great dinner cooked by the Admiral.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we are heading to Fernandina Harbor Marina on Amelia Island…our first port in Florida.</p>
<p>More tomorrow…Guest Blogger Connie</p>
