<h1>October 31, 2022 – Day 9 – Mile 680 to Mile 717</h1>

<p>We cast off this morning at 0930hrs headed to the Brunswick River continuing our journey south. We passed under the Sidney Lanier Bridge (Georgia’s tallest cable-stayed suspension bridge). The bridge is named after Georgian Poet Sidney Lanier.</p>
<p>Captain Bill spotted our first manatee today but it disappeared before the rest of us saw it.</p>
<p>Low tide was ~0630hrs and we wanted to be sure the tide was high enough so we could enter the East River and stop for fuel at the Jekyll Island Marina. After calling around it was determined that they had the cheapest diesel fuel especially compared to Florida where we are heading.</p>
<p>Please skip this paragraph if you are not into minutiae and are not considering becoming a boat owner…. Just to put it in perspective…the boat has two – 250-gallon tanks which hold diesel fuel…at 5.43/gal it costs ~$2700 to fill the tanks.  Our speed has been ~10 mph (1600 rpm) and we get 1.7 miles/gallon.  A 60-mile day burns about 35 gallons – so $190/day.</p>
<p>We were briefly out in the Atlantic where the water was a bit rough before entering the Cumberland River passing by Cumberland Island…home to the Cumberland National Seashore where we spotted some of the wild horses.</p>
<p>We passed by the King’s Bay Naval Submarine base which is home to the Navy’s ballistic missile nuclear submarines AKA Boomers. Needless to saw it is well guarded.</p>
<p>We entered Florida as we passed Fort Clinch State Park on Amelia Island. Amelia Island known as the “Isle of Eight Flags” is part of the Sea Islands chain of barrier islands, on Florida’s Atlantic coast. It has a history of Spanish, French, British and American rule.</p>
<p>We are now docked at the Fernandina Beach Marina on Amelia Island.  Just down the dock from us is the “Double Down” a 214 ft mega yacht.  For more about the yacht, click on the link.</p>

<p>After docking we walked into the town of Fernandina Beach which is very charming.  We stopped to have a drink at the Palace Saloon, billed as the oldest bar in Florida.</p>
<p>We came back to the boat to enjoy a beautiful sunset and another great dinner by Admiral Adrienne.</p>
<p>More tomorrow…. Guest Blogger Connie</p>
