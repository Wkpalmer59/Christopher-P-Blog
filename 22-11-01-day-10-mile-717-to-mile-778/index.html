<p>As we prepared to leave Brunswick Marina this morning, we had a friendly Egret sitting on our stern line (see picture).</p>
<p>We left Fernandina Beach at 8:50 AM following the Intracoastal Waterway past the Timiucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, up Broward Creek to Sisters Creek past the Naval Station at Mayport.</p>
<p>At 9:41 AM we saw the launch of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy USSF-44.  As the Kennedy Space Center is still 100 miles to the south, we didn’t see it until it was up in the sky.</p>
<p>We continued down Pablo Creek to the Tolomato River.  We went through 6+ miles of mega mansions on the waterway.</p>
<p>We are docked for the night at the St Augustine Municipal Marina. St. Augustine was “founded in 1565 by Spanish explorers, it is the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in what is now the contiguous United States.”</p>

<p>Docked right next to us is the pirate ship “Black Raven.”</p>
<p>The pistol shrimp (or snapping shrimp) can often be heard when we are docked…we also heard them as we walked back along the dock after dinner.  They make a distinct snapping noise (snap, crackle, pop).  According to Wikipedia, they can interfere with sonar or underwater communication and considered a major source of noise in the ocean.</p>
<p>We head to Daytona Beach next.</p>
<p>More tomorrow…Guest Blogger Connie</p>
