<p>We cast off from St. Augustine at 0825hrs and cruised along the Matanzas River to Smith Creek and finally to the Halifax River.  We are docked tonight at the Halifax Marina in Daytona.  We passed under two bascule bridges, one of which had to open for us, the other we just squeaked under.</p>
<p>We were again passing mega mansions along the waterway…I kept hoping at least some of them were boutique hotels.  We have been seeing abandoned boats all along the waterway also, but today there seemed to be more than usual…at least a couple every mile (see pictures), some of them entertaining.</p>

<p>We arrived here in Daytona about 1430hrs.  An osprey greeted us on a nearby boat.  We relaxed on the boat until it was time for dinner. We ate at a nearby Chart House (wasn’t sure they were still even around).</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we head for Cocoa Beach which will be our last port.</p>
<p>More tomorrow…Guest Blogger Connie</p>
