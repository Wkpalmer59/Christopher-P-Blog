<p>We left Daytona at 0825hrs and arrived here in Cocoa Beach ~1530hrs.  Over the last 12 days we have traveled 543 miles.  As we will be here in Cocoa Beach until we fly home to California on Nov 8th this will be my last post as the guest blogger. :-(</p>
<p>On our trip today we finally saw multiple manatees as we passed through the Haulover Canal from the Indian River (and the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge).  We also saw a lot of dolphins which are now considered barely worth comment. Oh how quickly interests change.</p>
<p>Once again the shoreline was dotted with more abandoned boats and mega mansions.</p>
<p>We also passed under the NASA Causeway near the Kennedy Space Center where we could see the launch pads from which the Artemis I is scheduled to be launched on November 14th at 0007hrs. The Captain plans to get up and watch the launch so maybe he will send some videos.  Most people would just stay up, but the Captain has a large dose of his father’s genes and falls asleep around 2000hrs while making a valiant effort to stay awake until we all head to bed at 2100hrs.</p>
<p>We have thoroughly enjoyed our trip with the Captain and Admiral and hopefully we will invited back to join them next year for at least a few days while they do “The Loop.”</p>
