<p>We are settled in Cocoa FL and I am back to work. We will be here for the next couple of months as I prepare for my retirement on 2/1.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to thank our guest blogger for her great posts as we took our trip south. It was great to spend some quality time with my California sister and brother-in-law as we don&#39;t get to see them very often. They fly out on Tuesday and we will settle back into our routine.</p>
<p>We will hopefully have some good video and pictures to post of the Artemis launch on the 14th.</p>
<p>Thanks all!</p>
