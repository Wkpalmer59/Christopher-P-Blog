<h1>Hurricane Nicole</h1>
<p>Yes, that&#39;s right Nicole is forecast to be a Cat 1 hurricane before it makes land fall just south of us, which puts us on the windiest side of the storm. We have prepared the boat the best we can and I have booked a hotel room for tomorrow night.</p>
<p>We dropped off Connie and Chris at the airport earlier this afternoon so they are getting out of dodge just in time.</p>
<p>I will post again on Thursday after we get back to the boat and take an assessment.</p>
<p>Thanks to those of you that have reached out.</p>
<p>Capt. Bill and the Admiral</p>
