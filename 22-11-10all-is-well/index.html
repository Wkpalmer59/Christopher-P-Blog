<h1>All is Well</h1>
<p>We spent the night in a hotel last night and I was able to monitor the boat via the camera I have on the mast. The internet actually stayed up all night and it got pretty ugly around 4am. (that&#39;s right I didn&#39;t get much sleep). We got back to the boat around 10:30 and found everything in order. No damage to be found and only a couple of minor water leaks in the cabin.</p>
<p>We will spend the next few days putting the bridge enclosure back up and getting everything back in order. I think we really dodged a bullet on this one.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your thoughts and prayers!</p>
