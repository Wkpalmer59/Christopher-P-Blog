<p>We have been spending the weekend trying to get everything back in order. I was surprised by the wear on the piling when removing the extra lines from the boat (picture above). That piling did not have any marks on it prior to the hurricane. Glad I had the lines doubled up!</p>
<p>Monday morning I will back to work in my office on the bridge and out of the Admiral&#39;s way!</p>
