<h1>Update</h1>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We have spent the past couple of months enjoying the Florida weather with a trip up north for a few weeks for the holidays. I am looking forward to my retirement at the end of January and we have been doing projects around the boat to get ready for some extended cruising.</p>
<p>We will be going to Disney for a week in early February and then plan to head down to the Keys with the boat. We have decided to delay our Great Loop trip for a year based on a couple of factors including a family get together on the Maine coast this summer. We had planned to cruise the Maine coast in the summer of 2024 and have now decided to do that this summer instead and push the Loop trip to 2024.</p>
<p>Once we depart for the Keys we will be doing regulars blog updates. The plan is to spent a few weeks in the Keys and then head back up the coast spending some time in the St. Johns river and the Chesapeake Bay. Goal is to hit Milford in early June and then head up to Maine. No set schedule!!! Yay!</p>
<p>Please check back here in mid February to follow along.</p>
<p>Thanks! Capt. Bill and Admiral</p>
