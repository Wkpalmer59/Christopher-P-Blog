<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We were delayed a week due to a mechanical issue, but we got that straightened out and headed out today for our trip to the Keys. Weather was great! We originally planned to stop in Vero Beach but decided to push on to Jensen Beach where my brother is located. We will spend a few days here and head further south on Tuesday. Hoping to be in the Keys by next weekend.</p>
<p>Had several dolphins escort us along the way. It never gets old! Check back next week for more updates.</p>
