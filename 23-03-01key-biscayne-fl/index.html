<p>Great day today; ran off shore from Lake Worth inlet to Ft Lauderdale. The highlight of the ocean run was witnessing schools of flying fish. We tried to capture video, but they were just too small and quick!</p>
<p>We also saw what looked like some kind of photo shoot, guess we will have to wait and see if it shows up on our favorite TV show. :)</p>

<p>We jumped inside into the waterway where we traveled through Miami to Key Biscayne where we anchored for the night. Got treated to a great sunset.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will head further down into the Keys with a plan to hit Key West on Sunday.</p>
