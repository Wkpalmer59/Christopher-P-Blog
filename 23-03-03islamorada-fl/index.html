<h1>Islamorada, FL</h1>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We cruised the inland waterway down to Islamorada yesterday. Beautiful ride with crystal clear water. A little stressful as this is the most shallow part of the inland waterway; we got a little tired of listening to the depth alarm.</p>
<p>We got in the middle of some kind of power boat race and had them all passing us, some very closely at very high speed and with a lot of noise. We passed the restaurant where they gathered for lunch and then a little later they passed us again! See pictures and videos below.</p>
<p>Once we anchored in Islamorada we took the dinghy into Lorelei&#39;s and had dinner and a few beers with our good friend John. Great to catch up with him!</p>

<p>We will stay here today as the wind is blowing pretty good and then tomorrow we will head down to Marathon and then on to Key West on Saturday.</p>
