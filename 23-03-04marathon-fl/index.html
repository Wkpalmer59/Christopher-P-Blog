<p>Hi All</p>
<p>Had a relatively easy short run in Hawk Channel today from Islamorada down to Marathon. It was a little rocky and rolly but it laid down nice by the end of the day. Found a decent place to anchor in a very tight Marathon harbor, but the wind is calm so it should be a quiet night. A little on the warm side (I know, wah, wah). Caught another great sunset. (can you see the alligator eating the sun?)</p>
<p>Tomorrow we have a short run on the outside to Key West where will spend three nights.</p>
