<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We made it to Key West where we will spend the next two days. On the way down the Admiral got to enjoy a rum and coconut drink out of a fresh coconut. (Thanks Clark!)</p>
<p>We had a nice calm run down the Hawk Channel from Marathon, but it did get quite warm as we were traveling with the wind so there was essentially no breeze.</p>
<p>We are not entirely thrilled with our marina choice (Stock Island Yacht Club and Marina, sounds nice, right?). It is far away from downtown Key West, which we knew, but we thought they had shuttle service, which they don&#39;t. The basin we are in is tight with buildings all around so no good sunrises/sunsets. (I know wah, wah, again) Facilities are OK, but nothing to write home about. All in all it wouldn&#39;t be bad, but for what they charge it should be way nicer.</p>
<p>We are near the Naval Air Station, so we get to watch the fighter jets, which is cool: https://youtube.com/shorts/__yMCdG2kEA?feature=share</p>
<p>We also have some cool jellyfish swimming around the boat with water actually clear enough to see them! https://youtube.com/shorts/iqxPwa3XGGg?feature=share</p>
<p>We plan to explore in the dinghy today and then take an Uber into town tomorrow. There is a cruise ship in port today, but none tomorrow so it should be a little less crowded downtown tomorrow.</p>
<p>I will add a post if we see anything exciting while we are here, otherwise I&#39;ll add an update when we start heading back north on Wednesday.</p>
