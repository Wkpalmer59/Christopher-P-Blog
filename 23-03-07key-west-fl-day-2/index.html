<p>Went for a dinghy ride last evening and caught a nice sunset since we can&#39;t see it from our spot in the marina :-(</p>
<p>Today we took an Uber into town today and did the tourist thing.</p>

<p>We were going to stop at the Mighty Cock for a drink, but there was a guard cock blocking our way in: https://youtube.com/shorts/EeZsjcFMiOI?feature=share</p>
<p>Finally, all the way down the waterway from Cocoa we have been slowing down for Manatee zones and haven&#39;t seen one manatee. On our way back to the boat after being dropped off at the marina, we saw this manatee lazing about in an empty slip: https://youtube.com/shorts/7TM8TJOquLo?feature=share</p>
<p>Busy day today, tomorrow we start working our way back up north.</p>
