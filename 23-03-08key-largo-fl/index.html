<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>After walking around doing the tourist thing in Key West and looking at a windy forecast we decided to start heading back north. Before we left though, we got go to see some manatees in the marina basin (picture above) and one even decided to try and drink from our air conditioner discharge. He was looking for fresh water and was quickly disappointed: https://youtube.com/shorts/Ux9OSc34ikk?feature=share</p>
<p>We thought we were going to have a relatively calm day today, but  NOAA lies!  It was a little snotty for the first few hours and the boat took a lot of salt spray, but it calmed down later and we are now anchored in Black Water Sound in Key Largo.</p>
<p>We had some playful dolphins join us along the way (again, never gets old) and they put on a good show for us. https://youtube.com/shorts/5EgdbCsqArM?feature=share

<p>We plan to hang out here for a couple days and do some snorkeling in the John Pennenkamp State Park. We also have plans to meet up again with our friend John for cocktails, dinner and with his help, some re-provisioning ;-)</p>
