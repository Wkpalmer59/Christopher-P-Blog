<h1>Key Largo Day 3</h1>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We stayed on the hook Wednesday night and then tied up at the Anchorage Resort &amp; Yacht Club (sounds way nicer than it was) on Thursday where we met up with our friend John again. He was kind enough to give us a ride to the local Winn Dixie so we could re-supply. We then had dinner at the Blackwater Siren Grill, which is kind of a dive bar but with great food!</p>
<p>Today we moved back on the hook this time in Blackwater sound. We were going to take the dinghy through a canal to Key Largo Sound and try to do some snorkeling, but after talking to John we found we needed to go all the way out to the ocean side to get to really clean water and good reefs. It was pretty windy today and it would have been a very long dinghy ride to get out to the ocean, so we decided to stay put and relax (we are re &quot;tired&quot; now). We caught another great sunset. We also learned that it is a thing down here for people to blow conch shells at sunset, very cool.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will move a little further north to a different anchorage as the wind is going to shift to the southwest so we need get better protection from that direction.</p>
<p>Joke of the day...we got pumped out the other day and when the guy doing the pump out finished he said &quot;OK captain, that is about all the shit I can take from you today!&quot; Hadn&#39;t heard that one before. :-)</p>
