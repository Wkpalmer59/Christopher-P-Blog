<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We are back in Key Biscayne on our way back north. Featured picture above is our view of Miami skyline during the day today &amp; at night the last time we were anchored here.</p>
<p>Last night we found a nice secluded anchorage to duck into to get out of the wind and by sunset we were by ourselves.</p>

<p>In the morning we found a nice spot to land the dinghy and take a short walk on the beach where we saw a lot of aged felled tree roots.</p>

<p>On the way to Key Biscayne we got waked by a very inconsiderate boater with a large boat (and small something else) and the Admiral&#39;s 1,000 piece partially constructed puzzle that was on the bridge table in a puzzle caddy hit the deck and got pretty messed up. She was not impressed.</p>
<p>We are now in a an anchorage with half of the city of Miami. It is Sunday afternoon on a beautiful day, so it is to be expected. We are hoping that it will calm down some after sunset.</p>

<p>Where we are anchored is close to &quot;Nixon&#39;s Beach&quot; which was the Florida White House when he was in office. You can see the pier to the far right in the picture below where they landed Marine One. The house is the one with the scaffolding to the left.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we head up the waterway to Palm Beach.</p>
