<h1>Palm Beach FL</h1>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Left Key Biscayne just before sunrise today and had a long day on the waterway to get north of all the bridges and slow areas in Miami and Ft Lauderdale. Got a taste of how the 1% lives, some of the estates are just crazy.</p>
<p>Got a visit from some dolphins again (seriously, never gets old).</p>

<p>Passed by Mar-A-Largo on the way.</p>

<p>We had planned on staying overnight in a nice little anchorage in Palm Beach that we scoped out on the way down; it has a public dock to land the dinghy and a nice park to walk in. However, they are gearing up for the Palm Beach boat show at the end of the month, and closed off the whole anchorage to put in temporary docks. Not happy! We anchored across the way and weathered the cold front and some rain as it came through.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will get an early start, get some fuel and then off to Jensen Beach where we look forward to spending time with Don &amp; Kim.</p>
