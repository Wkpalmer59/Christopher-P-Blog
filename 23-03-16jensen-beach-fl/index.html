<p>We are back in Jensen Beach where will spend a few days. We have been spoiled with a great stretch of good weather over the past couple of weeks and it is now a bit chilly and windy. We even had some rain on Wednesday...(again, wahwah). We had dinner last night at a great new restaurant (Circa69 American Gastropub) with my brother Don, Kim and their friends Jeff and Lisa. We plan to move on to Vero Beach on Saturday where we will connect with some more friends.</p>
