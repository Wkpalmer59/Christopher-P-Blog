<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Had a fairly short run up to Vero Beach today. It was awesome to catch up with the daughter of an old friend and her great kids!  It was a little windy on the way down and we are happy to tie up in a marina for a couple of nights to recharge batteries, and fill up on water and ice!</p>
