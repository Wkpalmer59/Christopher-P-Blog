<h1>Cocoa, FL</h1>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We are back in Cocoa for a couple of weeks to restock and get some projects done before we continue our way back north. On our second morning in Vero we hosted a breakfast onboard with a former coworker &amp; fellow retiree Jeff C and his wife Darlene. It was great to catch up with them, and I forgot to get a picture!</p>
<p>We had a very windy day traveling from Vero to Cocoa. It was quite challenging getting the boat into the slip, but we got her in without any damage. As I always say, any landing that doesn&#39;t do damage is a good landing, doesn&#39;t matter how ungraceful it may be!</p>
<p>I will post if there is anything exciting that happens while tied up here in Cocoa; otherwise check back in around the middle of April as we plan to start our journey back north by then.</p>
