<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I started our trip north on Tuesday with a substitute first mate, our good friend Clark. The Admiral and Clark&#39;s wife stayed behind and drove up to St. Augustine. Clark has had several boats in including a Mainship 36 double cabin and he has missed traveling the waterway, so we worked out a plan for him to get a boating fix.</p>
<p>We were scheduled to leave early Tuesday morning, but the Admiral and I woke up to a game of &quot;What&#39;s That Smell?&quot; and traced it to one of the bow thruster/inverter batteries under the forward cabin bunk. It was steaming away which could indicate a serious problem so we quickly turned off the charger and disconnected the battery to avert any further issues. We were fortunate to find some new batteries (AGM this time) in stock not too far away and the replacement was fairly easy, so we were able to get under way around 10:30.</p>
<p>We stopped in Daytona at Halifax Marina Tuesday night and after cocktails on the &#39;Lido Deck&#39;, we took a walk &amp; scored a corner spot in a local pub for dinner. Today we landed in St. Augustine where will spend 2 nights. Clark was able to enjoy some wheel time and we didn&#39;t have any other &quot;events&quot;. Admiral is safely back on board after harrowing highway travel (thanks Susan!) so on Friday we will continue our trip north with the next stop being Amelia Island. I will be posting daily, so feel free check back for updates.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all for now.</p>
<p>Capt. Bill</p>
