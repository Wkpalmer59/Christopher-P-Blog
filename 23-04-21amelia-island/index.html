<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Ran from St Augustine to Amelia Island today. It was a beautiful day with dolphins, large fish jumping &amp; beautiful homes along the waterway. The journey was mostly uneventful except for one very inconsiderate vessel that passed us very close with a large wake causing flying objects &amp; things hitting the deck...the salon door even slammed shut on its own! Fortunately no damage, just ruffled the Captain&#39;s feather a bit. Expressed some of my displeasure over the radio along with a quick lesson in proper waterway passing etiquette.</p>
<p>Walked into town for a bit and we are now back on the boat for cocktails and dinner. Short run planned for tomorrow to Jekyll Island.</p>
