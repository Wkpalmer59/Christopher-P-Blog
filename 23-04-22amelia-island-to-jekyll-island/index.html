<h1>Amelia Island to Jekyll Island</h1>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We started our day today with a walk through downtown Fernandina Beach. Beautiful historic town and we found a great park to walk through with what the Admiral called &quot;the best kid playground I have ever seen&quot;. It was called Teddy Bear Park dedicated to David Berkman. (see photos)</p>

<p>On our way back to the boat we passed a fresh seafood store and decided we needed to get some local shrimp since Amelia Island is renowned as the birth place of our modern shrimping industry.</p>
<p>We got in fairly early to Jekyll Harbor Marina where they offer courtesy golf carts so we took a short tour around the island. It was the Captain&#39;s first time driving a golf cart; needless to say, the Admiral was a little nervous.</p>

<p>Our tour included a stop at Driftwood Beach which was very cool. Evidently the trees were overtaken by erosion and left many impressive skeletons.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we have a long day through the winding Georgia waterway, fortunately we have the tide with us and will be able to get through some of the notorious shallow areas on the rising tide. We are planning to stop at a new marina tomorrow.</p>
