<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>There is a long stretch on the waterway in GA where there isn&#39;t many places to stop, so we have been searching for a good place to break it up a bit. We found this quiet marina on Skidaway Island. Not much going on here and the channel getting in was a little challenging on the low tide, but it fits the bill.</p>
<p>The waterway in Georgia is pretty boring, a lot of winding through marshes and creeks and it can be very challenging if it is low tide. See video here to get a sense: https://youtu.be/y0CqVtsHfOc</p>
<p>We did pass a festive shrimp boat that was having some sort of party which was fun (pic above). We also had the ever present gulls picking up something in our wake along the way (still not sure what it is they get, but clearly they enjoy it): https://youtube.com/shorts/29LTYUKMno4?feature=share</p>
<p>Tomorrow we cross over to South Carolina and will stop in Beaufort for two days.</p>
