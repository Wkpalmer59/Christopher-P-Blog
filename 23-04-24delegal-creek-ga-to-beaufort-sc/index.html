<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>So we have added a new stop to our list. Delegal Creek (think delegate with an &quot;all&quot; instead of &quot;ate&quot;) was a little challenging to get into, but we found a better route on the way out this morning and saved the track on our GPS for next time. What a nice peaceful place! (see pic above). There wasn&#39;t anything close by which is what made it quiet, but they do offer a golf cart to get to the grocery store if you need it. We took a walk in the morning through a beautiful quiet neighborhood where all the streets are named using sailing terms &amp; the signs are all carved wood. We saw an aloe plant that was easily 6&#39; tall &amp; very wide as well &amp; the pond had turtles swimming around. We also climbed the the lookout tower at the marina for a great view!</p>

<p>Tonight we are at Lady&#39;s Island Marina in Beaufort which is a first for us and may become another stop on the list. It is a dinghy ride away from downtown Beaufort and they offer a courtesy car for running for supplies.  We will spend an extra day here exploring around this side of the island along with taking the dinghy across the way to our old stomping grounds of downtown.</p>
<p>Charleston, SC is our next stop on Wednesday.</p>
