<p>So, we definitely found another stop to add to the list. We have always stopped at the Beaufort downtown marina, which is great because it is right in the historic district and has good access to shops and restaurants. We were unable to get a spot over there this time so we booked a spot at Lady&#39;s Island Marina across the river and were pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>The marina staff was very accommodating and helped us get into a tight spot. They had a loaner vehicle (picture above) so we were able to stock up on supplies and the onsite restaurant was great!</p>

<p>The marina is located on factory creek and during our morning walk we found out how it got it&#39;s name.</p>

<p>Coming north you pass under the Lady&#39;s Island swing bridge before turning into factory creek, which is one of the few remaining bridges on the intracoastal waterway that has not been replaced by a high overpass.</p>

<p>When the waterway was first built back in the early 1900&#39;s, the bridges over the waterway consisted of swing, bascule, lift and platoon bridges to allow for large vessels to pass. Because of the high maintenance and requirements for staffing, most of the bridges have been replaced with 65&#39; high over passes. Fortunately with our ability to clear bridges at 19&#39; or more, we do not have to request openings for many of the remaining bridges. This particular bridge with a 30&#39; clearance is restricted to openings on the 1/2 hour &amp; NO openings during rush hour (6am to 8am and 4pm to 6pm).  Big bummer if you are over 30&#39; &amp; don&#39;t time it right!</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will move on to Charleston, SC</p>
