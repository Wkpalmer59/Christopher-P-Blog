<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Pretty uneventful day today (which is OK!). We are tied up at the Charleston City Marina &quot;Mega Dock&quot;. Here we are one of the smallest boats.</p>
<p>We didn&#39;t get in and settled until almost 4pm. We left a little late today to make sure we had the rising tide for a few shoaling areas on the waterway. There is nothing to do close by here (we would need to take the shuttle to downtown which we have done previous trips), so we will just have dinner on the boat and crash early. Tomorrow we are going to Georgetown where we plan to spend 2 nights.</p>
