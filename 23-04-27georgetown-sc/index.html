<h1>Georgetown, SC</h1>

<p>We left Charleston this morning about 8am and passed the largest power catamaran I have ever seen, 80 feet! It was a good day with no &quot;incidents&quot;. We arrived in Georgetown about 3pm where we will spend two nights. Weather tomorrow is going to be rainy and windy, so we decided to stay put.</p>
<p>Along the way we passed one of the more interesting &quot;bridges&quot; on the waterway. This is fairly new and is rarely used. I have passed through here many times and have never seen it across the canal.</p>

<p>They use the small motor on the barge to swing it across the canal and then drop the ramps so cars can drive over it. It connects the Yawkey-South Island Reserve to the mainland.</p>
<p>We spotted a &quot;Mary Kay&quot; boat and the ever present pelicans with this one posing for us.</p>

<p>And of course we had some dolphin hitchhikers, again, never gets old. https://youtu.be/K_i9lo27adg</p>
