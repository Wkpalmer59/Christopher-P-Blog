<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We took a nice walk this morning before we left Georgetown. It seems that we do our best sight seeing on our morning walks. We passed the John and Mary Perry Cleland house (pics below) and apparently the current owners have a sense of humor. (pic above).</p>

<p>We then found a great park to walk through called East Bay Park which included a side trip to Morgan park, sight of the historic Fort Winyah (if anyone is interested about my story of Winyah Bay, I would be happy to tell you over a beer)</p>

<p>We then came upon a great idea for inspiring reducing of waste that enters our waterways.</p>

<p>On the way back to the boat we were treated to a great wake up call: https://youtu.be/2eB10PK_SnE</p>
<p>We are going to stay here at the Myrtle Beach Yacht Club for two days (yes, I said that with my lower jaw extended) as the weather for tomorrow is not great, and then we will move on to Carolina Beach when the weather permits.</p>
