<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We had a cold front come through on Sunday which brought some strong storms and then the wind came in behind it, so we decided to sit it out here at the Myrtle Beach Yacht Club. While we would be OK in the waterway with the wind, it would have been unpleasant and we decided we were doing this for fun and we are in no hurry, so why not hang out here for a few. I got oil changes done and did a little waxing and the Admiral did some cleaning and organizing. Today we rented a car, went grocery shopping and did the tourist thing. We played miniature golf at the Captain Hook golf course (where the Admiral beat the Captain by one stroke + scored the only hole-in-one).</p>

<p>After that fun adventure, we went for a stroll on the boardwalk.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will head out for Carolina Beach. It is still going to be a little windy, but it is out of a better direction and is supposed to lay down overnight into Thursday.</p>
