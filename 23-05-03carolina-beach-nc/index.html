<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We got an early start today to try and get a head start on the continued wind and were mostly successful. We had an uneventful trip up the waterway into North Carolina and then up the Cape Fear River (fortunately we did not run into Max Cady). We grabbed a mooring in Carolina Beach (current view pictured in above photo) where the wind was very gusty for most of the afternoon. It is finally calming down now and we should have a quiet and comfortably cool night. In the morning we will launch the dinghy and go ashore for a walk about before we shove off.</p>
<p>We have a short run tomorrow up the waterway to Harbor Village Marina in Hampstead NC.</p>
