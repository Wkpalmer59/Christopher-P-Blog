<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We spent a very windy evening on the mooring. Since only had 30 miles to do today our anticipated short day gave us the opportunity to launch the dinghy this morning and go for a walk. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the beach was only two blocks from the mooring field dinghy dock. We did a 2 mile walk on the beach where the Admiral got her beach fix.</p>

<p>We found it interesting that there was a rental company out before 8am setting up beach chairs and umbrellas. We were tempted to park for the day!</p>

<p>We also saw several large jelly fish washed up on the beach.</p>

<p>The marina we are at this evening is quiet and basically just a place to stop for the night, so we will get an early start tomorrow and move on the Morehead City.</p>
