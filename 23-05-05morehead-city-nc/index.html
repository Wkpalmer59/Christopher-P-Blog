<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Caught this great pic of the Christopher P on our walk this morning.</p>
<p>We shoved off around 8:15 and had a pleasant trip from Hampstead to Morehead City. We passed through Camp Lejeune and fortunately were not stopped by any live fire exercises, but we did however pass by some of the targets. (pictured below)</p>

<p>We arrived in Morehead City, NC around 3pm and found a great Mexican restaurant on the waterfront to celebrate Cinco De Mayo. The Admiral was able to get her margarita fix, so of course I had to get a Mexican beer and we shared some chips, salsa &amp; tacos.</p>

<p>The town was very active with a fishing tournament going on; drinking on the streets, live music &amp;  and we saw some of the fish being brought in and cleaned.</p>
