<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We found another spot to add to the list, this is a very quiet well protected harbor off of the Nuese River in North Carolina. It has great facilities, a nice club house and a restaurant. I was looking for something to break up the longer run from Beaufort to Belhaven and this fit the bill nicely being almost exactly half way. The downside is there is not much going on here although they have a tent set up for a big fundraising event that may prove to be interesting later.</p>
<p>While we were in Morehead City we spotted a sign touting a &quot;Jaws&quot; boat.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think much of it, but upon doing a Google search I found that it is actually the boat that inspired the book &quot;Jaws&quot; and is now used take disabled veterans on fishing trips. You can read more here: https://cricket2project.com/about-us</p>
<p>We also caught a picture of the Admiral posing with Neptune and passed an impressive fountain with names of all past winners of the Morehead City annual Marlin fishing tournament.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we head to Belhaven and will reconnect with an old friend from our Stratford Marina days. (over forty years ago....imagine!)</p>
