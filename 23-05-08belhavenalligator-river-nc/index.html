<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We arrived in Belhaven yesterday afternoon around 1pm and we were able to reconnect with an old friend from (dare I say it) over 40 years ago. We spent an enjoyable afternoon and evening with Don and his wife Vicky touring their stomping grounds around the Belhaven and Washington NC area. The above photo was taken up on a rooftop bar in downtown Washington where we enjoyed cocktails &amp; conversation.</p>
<p>We had somewhat of a rough night on the boat as the wind came up strong and kicked up some wave pushing us against the dock. Other than some lost sleep everything is OK. This morning we headed through the Alligator River/Pungo River canal (20 miles of nothing) and are currently at anchor in the Alligator river.</p>
<p>We did encounter some wild life on our walk this morning.</p>

<p>We were going try taking the Dismal Swamp route to Norfolk tomorrow, which would have been something new for us. However, after reviewing the lock schedules, it would require a 3 hour wait between locks, so instead we will go to Coinjock and get some prime rib! I also need to replace the Coinjock koozie that I left in Don&#39;s car (yes Don, you can keep it as a souvenir).</p>
