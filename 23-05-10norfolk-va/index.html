<p>After having our prime rib dinner last night, we left Coinjock at 6am this morning so we could make it through the Great Bridge Lock on the 10am opening. It is currently running on a limited schedule due to an electrical malfunction so timing the bridges was an important task today. It is the only lock on the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and only has a small change in water level. We locked through with only 7 other boats; part of our reasoning for 6am shove off after taking stock of our company in Coinjock. We noted from the sign below that we have traveled 1236 miles from our Key West venture!</p>

<p>After passing through the lock we stopped for fuel at a marina that is known for it&#39;s low fuel prices and they had the lowest price ($3.259) that we have seen since the start of the Ukraine war.</p>
<p>We docked at the Waterside Marina in Norfolk VA around lunch time which gave us some time to walk around and tour the battleship Wisconsin which was very impressive!</p>
