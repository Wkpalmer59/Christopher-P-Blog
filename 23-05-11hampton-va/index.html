<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We did a short run today to Hampton VA where we were able to reconnect with another good friend Malcolm, from (dare I say again, over 40 years ago) and had great time catching up and talking about old times.</p>
<p>We went for our morning walk before leaving Norfolk and were awed by the history of the city and it&#39;s naval heritage. We were particularly moved by a memorial that was designed to look like letters scattered in the wind, and were replicas of actual letters from service men that didn&#39;t make it back from wars dating back to the Revolutionary War up to the Gulf War.</p>

<p>It looks like we may spend a couple of days here to wait for better weather before we head up the Chesapeake Bay. It will be fun to spend more time with Malcolm and also gather any local knowledge he can provide us on the best ports to visit in the Bay.</p>
