<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We decided to stay here for a few days to wait for some better weather before we head up the Chesapeake Bay. It gave us a chance to spend some quality time with Malcom and see some of the sights.</p>
<p>We decided to move the boat from the downtown marina on Friday to a not to far quieter marina after we got woken up at 1:30am by some folks that decided they wanted to have an impromptu party in the parking garage right behind our boat. We are now in a much more peaceful marina with a great restaurant where we enjoyed a meal at the prime spot corner of the bar. I got to spend some time with Malcom discussing the best ports to visit on the bay. (picture above, note my iPad with electronic charts and his paper charts that he brought along; I have to say there there is a lot to be said about both).</p>
<p>We had a nice relaxing Mother&#39;s Day, where the Admiral and I collaborated on a yummy eggs benedict brunch with mimosas.</p>

<p>On our morning walks we passed the Hampton Carousel and also found that this is where Blackbeard met his demise, both very interesting history.</p>
