<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We left Hampton early this morning with a good forecast thinking we could put the lower Chesapeake Bay easily behind us. Well, NOAA lies! Forecast claimed 5-10 knot winds with 1-2 foot waves; well it was more like 10-15 with 2-4 foot waves. It was a rough ride for most of the morning, but we decided to push on and it calmed down as we moved up the bay. We made it to the Solomons and it is quite beautiful here.</p>
<p>The Admiral broke out a treat once we were docked to calm her nerves as I washed all the salt off the boat. (Full disclosure, she did squeegee the curtains for me first).</p>

<p>We will spend a day or two here as the weather forecast for the next couple of days is not great and it will give us a chance to explore.</p>

<p>Once the weather cooperates we will move up to Queenstown, MD to the new Hole in the Wall Game Camp location to visit with those folks and discuss the technology plan for the new camp in this location.</p>
