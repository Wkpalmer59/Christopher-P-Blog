<h1>Solomons (Day 2)</h1>

<p>This is such a great spot (thus far an Admiral favorite); a very quaint &amp; peaceful harbor with lots to see. It is on the Patuxent River and near the Patuxent naval air station so we do get the occasional jet or helicopter fly over, which is always cool. As usual we learned a lot on our morning walk. They have a great water front here with a ton of history. Pics below only touch on the history.</p>

<p>We then took a long dinghy ride around the harbor and were were surprised by all the beautiful homes and marinas tucked up inside the many creeks and coves.</p>

<p>We pulled the dinghy up to a local restaurant for lunch and, of course, had to have the local flavor, Maryland crab cakes for lunch. We will stay here for one more day as it is supposed to blow tomorrow and then we will move on to the new Hole in the Wall Gang Camp location over in Queenstown, MD.</p>
