<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We took an extra long walk yesterday morning and explored some more of Solomons Island. As we passed the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory we saw some students gathering specimens and we overheard them keeping an eye out for something specific.</p>

<p>We also passed a school where the Admiral is considering applying for a job.</p>

<p>This morning we got an early start and pushed through some less than desirable conditions, but things laid down and we had a pleasant trip up the Wye River to the new Maryland location for the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. Fortunately we were able to get all the way up to the existing dock on the property. Upon our arrival, our gracious host Padraig treated us to personal a tour of this magnificent property. More detail to come on a later post. We will spend a day here so I can review their current progress from a data network perspective and assist with future plans.</p>
