<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We spent the day at the Hole In The Wall Camp location and I helped them turn up some wireless for a couple of rooms in the Houghton House that they will be using over the next few months.</p>
<p>On the way in we went up the Wye East River and past Wye island which was all part of the huge Wye Plantation. On the way out we got a good view of the plantation house and the black sheep on the lawn.</p>

<p>On our morning walks we got the opportunity to further explore the beautiful property that will one day be an awesome camp for the kids Hole In The Wall serves.</p>

<p>We also saw many of the Black Angus cows that are raised by the University of Maryland.</p>

<p>Yesterday our host let us use a vehicle to get some supplies and while out we stopped to eat at the Crab Deck where the Admiral had yummy crab rolls (just like a lobster roll, but with fresh crab meat).</p>

<p>Today we are headed further up the Chesapeake Bay to Rock Hall, MD where we will spend two days.</p>
