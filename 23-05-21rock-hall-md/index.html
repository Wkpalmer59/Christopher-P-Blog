<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Yet another port that goes on our list to visit again. This is a small harbor and town, but very quaint with a New England feel. Instead of golf carts as mode of transportation there were many bikes with baskets on the handlebars available. The town was less than a mile from the marina so we opted to walk.</p>
<p>They even do interesting paintings on their storm drains; this pirate face &amp; parrot is just one example</p>

<p>We also think we may have found our next house here; I mean come on, if we have to live on land.....</p>

<p>We spent an extra day here to wait out small craft warning and are glad we did, it was very pleasant last night and we took a dinghy ride today to explore the rest of the harbor.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will head up the bay to the C&amp;D Canal and will stop in Chesapeake City.</p>
<p>On our morning walk before leaving we passed this tribute to the Oysterman.</p>
