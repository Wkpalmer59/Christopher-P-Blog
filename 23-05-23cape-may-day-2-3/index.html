<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We have enjoyed our stay here is Cape May as we waited for the weather and bridges on the NJ waterway to cooperate with us. We took advantage of the free shuttle van provided by the marina and traveled into town each day for lunch and some exploring. We visited the beach, played some mini golf (the Captain won this time), restocked our provisions and even got some laundry done on premise. While the marina was a bit over our budget, it is in a great location, the facilities are top notch and the staff was great.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will embark on a new adventure up the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway. In the past I have always run off shore, but hopefully this is a great way to avoid the rough seas that can be encountered in the Atlantic Ocean on the Jersey Coast. We will go to Atlantic City and then on to Manasquan, where will will jump outside up to New York Harbor and then on to Long Island Sound. See our CT friends &amp; fa soon!!</p>
