<p>We left early this morning to try and take advantage of the calmer weather which worked well for the first part of our trip down the Delaware Bay, but as it got later the wind came up and it got pretty &quot;sporty&quot;. The Admiral was not impressed. https://youtube.com/shorts/DsOBEDpwLAE?feature=share</p>
<p>The Christopher P handled it well and we are now tied up in Cape May and the massive amount of salt spray we took has been washed off.</p>
<p>Looks like we are here until Friday as it is supposed to blow out of the northeast for the next few days and there is a bridge that is closed on the NJ waterway until Friday. We will then head up to Atlantic City.</p>
