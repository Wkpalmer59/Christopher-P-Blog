<p>Yesterday we stayed at a small marina in Chesapeake City which has a rich history centered around the digging of the C&amp;D Canal.</p>
<p>In the early days of the canal, barges were pulled through using horses and mules.</p>

<p>The marina we stayed at was very busy as it was attached to a restaurant/Tiki bar featuring live music even on a Monday night...we can&#39;t imagine what it must be like on a weekend during the peak of summer!</p>
