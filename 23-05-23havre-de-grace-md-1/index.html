<p>We arrived in Havre De Grace on Tuesday and spent two nights here. This has become another one of our favorite stops. There is a lot of history here, which is depicted in the many murals painted in a park by the marina. We met and chatted with the local artist as he was working on the final area of the murals. Interesting to note as well that in 1799, Havre de Grace was considered to become our nations capital, losing to Washington DC by only one vote.</p>
<p>Back in the day there was a lot going on here including, gambling, horse racing, duck hunting and even a local brothel. In 2011, the American Horse of the Year racehorse was number 2, Havre de Grace, whose name derived from the city and racetrack here in Maryland.</p>

<p>There is another local park with a boardwalk  by the water which was perfect for our morning walks.</p>

<p>We also spent some time learning a lot of interesting facts while browsing the Decoy Museum that has preserved the historical and cultural legacy of waterfowling and decoy making on the Chesapeake Bay. After, we enjoyed the view from a brewery near the marina followed by a great dinner at a local restaurant. Spanish grilled octopus was on the menu with the following disclaimer: Not for the faint of heart. Tentacle and suckers included. NO REFUNDS if you decide you can’t stomach it. Apparently everyone in our party is faint of heart.</p>

<p>Today we will take a short trip to Chesapeake City which will set us up for the C&amp;D Canal and a run down the Delaware Bay to Cape May tomorrow.</p>
