<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Yesterday we ran the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway from Cape May to Atlantic City as the off shore forecast was not good, and judging from the wind in the waterway it was a good choice. However, it was an adventure. We have never done it before and the markers are tricky and it gets very shallow in spots. To add insult to injury it was Friday before Memorial Day weekend, so we had a lot of boat traffic with fisherman crowding the channel. We did bump bottom once while trying to navigate around one fisherman (in the middle of a particularly skinny part of the channel of course) and made the wrong choice as to which side to take. There was no apparent damage as the bottom is soft mud, just some more paint scrapped off the under part of the keel.</p>
<p>Just short of AC we had a bridge that we needed to open and just as the bridge tender was about to open, several fire trucks went over the bridge and the tender told us he had to hold the opening until the vehicles went back over the bridge. We were in a tight area with three other boats jockeying around in the wind, which was difficult to say the least. After about 45 minutes of that we decided to head back a little way to give both Captain &amp; shifters a break.  We found an open dock within sight of where the fire trucks were and tied up to kill some time. There was a friendly gentleman on the dock who helped us tie up and also informed us that the problem was a broken sprinkler head in the building where the fire trucks were and they couldn&#39;t leave until someone came out to fix it; (remember this is about 4pm on the Friday of Memorial Day weekend). Just as I was about to shutdown the engines and get comfortable, we noticed that the trucks were packing it in and leaving, so we quickly untied and headed back over to the bridge for the opening. All said and done, we were delayed about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>We finally got tied up in AC about 6pm, had a quick &quot;Docktail&quot; with the other boats that waited at the bridge with us (fellow loopers from Michigan), went back to the boat for dinner, watched an episode of Succession then settled down for a well deserved night of sleep.</p>
<p>This morning the weather forecast looked good so we decided to run offshore to avoid any more nonsense in the waterway Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. It turned out to be a good choice. Pretty big swells early part of the trip but this boat rides them well!</p>

<p>As you can see in above pic, today was pretty calm which can be rare for the Jersey coast! We then decided to make the most of it by making a quick stop for fuel in Manasquan where we had originally planned to spend the night but instead pushed on to Sandy Hook, NJ  (top photo is our current view). We are anchored here for the night which is a little rocky &amp; rolly due to all the boat activity, but it should calm down this evening. Tomorrow we will have a short run across the New York outer harbor, through Verrazano Narrows and then up the East River into Long Island Sound. We will stop in Manhasset Bay where we look forward to meeting up with Lance, the previous owner of this boat.</p>
