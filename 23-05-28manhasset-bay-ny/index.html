<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>As you can see below, we were treated to a great sunset last night at anchor in Sandy Hook NJ.</p>

<p>This morning we got underway about 10:30am and got the incoming tide through NY Harbor and up the East River. Caught some great views of the NY City skyline and the Verrazano Narrows bridge.</p>

<p>We also saw military helicopters fly overhead:</p>

<p>Then we got the usual show of the planes landing at LaGuardia as we traveled up the East River into Long Island Sound:</p>

<p>We are now on a mooring enjoying the lovely view off the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club (top photo, thanks Lance!) where we will hang out until Wednesday. We will then head up the Housatonic River to Dockside Brewery in our hometown of Milford CT.</p>
