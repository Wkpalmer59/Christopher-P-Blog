<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We have spent 3 very pleasant days on a mooring in Manhasset Bay while waiting for the winds to subside. We have been treated to great sunsets, and nice visit from Lance (former boat owner) and his son Mike. There is a great park here for our morning walks and there is dock across the street from a Stop and Shop for provisioning. There is even an old tug boat wheel house with Popeye at the wheel.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will head up Long Island Sound to the Housatonic River and will tie up at the Dockside Brewery for the weekend before we head over to Milford harbor for two weeks to get things ready for our next adventure up to Maine. (oh, and also get all our doctors appointments out of the way.)</p>
