<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We had a nice calm ride today from Manhasset Bay up Long Island Sound to the Housatonic River, our old stomping grounds. We passed Stratford Marina (picture above) where I met the Admiral (of course she wasn&#39;t the Admiral then, she was the hot chick in the yellow terry cloth bikini ;) We also went by the house I grew up in, (pic below) where I noticed some improvements that I appreciated.</p>

<p>And finally we passed under the Devon Bridge (which I may, or may not, have jumped off of as a kid) and tied up at the Dockside Brewery.</p>

<p>We were met by our welcoming committee (Drew and Colleen) and had a nice dinner.</p>

<p>We will be here through the weekend and will then head over over to Milford Harbor for some maintenance and re-provisioning before we embark on our next adventure up to Maine.</p>
