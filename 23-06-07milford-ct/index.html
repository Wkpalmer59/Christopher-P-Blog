<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We are tied up in Milford Harbor at Lisman Landing which will be our home until June 19th when we will begin working our way up to Maine. We have a bunch of projects, doctor appointments and some re-provisioning to do in the mean time.</p>
<p>Our first night here was not uneventful as we were awoken at 2:00am to play the &quot;what&#39;s that noise?&quot; game. We quickly realized that there was some dumbass fishing on the pier across the harbor from us that misjudged his cast, landed his lure on our bow pulpit &amp; got his hooks tangled in our dinghy line. We had to snip all the hooks to save the line but was glad the line took the hit &amp; missed our inflatable dinghy!!</p>
<p>We are currently dealing with heavy smoke in the air from wild fires up in Canada. It is so bad that it is obscuring the sun and causing our eyes to burn. You can even taste it. Our local weatherman just verified the worst air quality in the whole world is right where we are, thickest at the coast.</p>

<p>Hopefully it is going to clear out by Saturday! We will be hosting a group onboard as part of a bachelorette weekend for a friend of our daughter. The plan is to gather on the boat and enjoy a trip back to Dockside where they will continue the party celebrating her weekend.</p>
<p>Posts will be infrequent until we start moving again on the 19th.</p>
