<h1>Leaving Milford</h1>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Well it has been a whirl wind couple of weeks here in Milford. We keep saying that we stuffed 10 pounds of stuff into a 5 pound bag. We hosted a bachelorette party for one of our daughters good friends (picture above),  went to many scheduled doctor/dentist appointments, re-provisioned and completed a list of repair projects.</p>
<p>We also had the boat hauled and got the bottom cleaned. https://youtube.com/shorts/g3HANht14bU?feature=share</p>

<p>Due to an unexpected root canal for the Captain and some bad weather we have been delayed several days, so we now only have 7 days to get the boat up to Booth Bay Maine for our family get together. If the weather cooperates, that should be enough time.</p>
<p>We are going to shove off at first light tomorrow and make it as far as the weather allows. Hopefully we can put Block Island and Rhode Island Sounds behind us and get up into Buzzards Bay. I will post an update once we hit port tomorrow, wherever that may be ;-)</p>
