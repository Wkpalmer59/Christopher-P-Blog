<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we had a delayed start this morning. The Admiral woke up in the middle of the night with an infection in her ear lob (evidently from her earring) which appeared to be spreading to her neck. Rather then take chances with an infection we made a trip to the urgent care and got her some antibiotics. We were still able to get underway about 9:30am and had an absolutely beautiful day. We cleared Long Island, Block Island and Rhode Island Sounds and even made it all the way up Buzzards Bay to just south of the Cape Cod Canal.</p>
<p>Along the way we passed Taylor Swift&#39;s house on Watch Hill, RI.</p>

<p>We waved an are quite certain Tay-tay waved back.</p>
<p>Then as we passed Charlestown Beach in Rhode Island we got a text from our friend Pam saying &quot;is that you, we see you from the beach?&quot;</p>

<p>Yep, we confirmed it was us passing by; what are the chances?</p>
<p>It was such a calm day, as you can see here:</p>

<p>We decided to take advantage of this and push on. We made our original goal of Onset, MA which sets us up really well for getting up to Booth Bay for our family get together which is Friday, June 30th.</p>
<p>It looks like we will have another good day tomorrow, so we may try to make Portsmouth, NH. We will post another update tomorrow.</p>
