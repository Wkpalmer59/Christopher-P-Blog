<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We had another nice calm day today so we decided to push on to Kittery (other side of the harbor from Portsmouth, NH). On the way we came through the Cape Cod Canal and timed it so we had the current behind us which can be as strong as 3 knots. We passed under the the canal railroad lift bridge (we got lucky because it closed for a train right after we went under it, which would have delayed us about 15 minutes). We also went under the Bourne (picture below, with the train bridge in the background) and Sagamore bridges, which are the only two bridges you can go over to get onto the Cape.</p>

<p>The canal was originally built in 1914 and the bridges in 1933. That makes the bridges 90 years old. Think about that the next time you drive over one of them. I would much rather go under :-). Here&#39;s some history on the canal: https://www.nae.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/Cape-Cod-Canal/History/</p>
<p>We are going to shoot for Portland, ME tomorrow, weather permitting of course, which will put us within a short run to Booth Bay where we need to be on Friday to join our family vacay.</p>
