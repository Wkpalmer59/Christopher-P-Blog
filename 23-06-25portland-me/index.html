<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We had a rather rough night last night on the mooring in Kittery. The mooring field was not well protected and we had some rather large waves coming in from the ocean that woke us up after midnight and kept us up for a while. It was calm when we got up in the morning, but was pretty foggy.</p>

<p>The fog lifted and revealed a beautiful sunny day and great scenery.</p>

<p>When we were ready to leave we found that the mooring line was badly tangled and we were unable to untangle it with the boat hook from the bow (we both tried). Finally I had to launch the dinghy and it still took me about 15 minutes to get it undone.</p>

<p>Here a video of the fun: https://youtube.com/shorts/kqUtRvUVzGs?feature=share</p>
<p>Once we got under way it was a very pleasant run up to Portland. We will stay here for at least 2 days and may end up being here until Friday waiting for a good day to move on to Booth Bay for our family gathering.</p>
