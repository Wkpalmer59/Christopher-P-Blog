<h1>Portland, Day 3</h1>

<p>We are getting a little tired of the fog and the rain. We have been here three days and have yet to go across the harbor to downtown Portland to explore. We even got caught in the rain on our morning walk this morning.</p>

<p>We did find a nice &quot;greenway&quot; for our morning walks, and it also leads to the grocery store. It has some interesting sites and some of it goes along the shoreline.</p>

<p>We do have a couple of fishing charter boats on the dock with us that have provided some entertainment. This morning, while fishing off his boat right across us on our dock, one of the captains caught a rather large striped bass but it was not a &quot;keeper&quot;. They recently changed the regulations to protect the larger fish as well as the smaller ones. You can only keep the fish if it is between 28 and 35 inches, and you can only keep one per person. This one was clearly larger then 35 inches.</p>

<p>We are hoping for better weather tomorrow, so we can launch the dinghy and do some more exploring and so far the weather looks good on Friday for us to travel to Boothbay for our family get together.</p>
