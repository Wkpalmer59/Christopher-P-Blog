<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We arrived in Boothbay on Friday after an interesting ride in the fog and swells coming in off the ocean. We passed several other boats within a 1/2 mile but never physically saw them, just watched them on the radar. We are here for the week where our family (19 of us ) rented a house with a mooring for our boat (picture above is the view from the boat). Unfortunately the fog just won’t lift for any length of time. Here is a picture of the boat from the house, in the fog, of course.</p>

<p>We took a tour boat out of Boothbay harbor yesterday which took us out to Cabbage Island for a clam/lobster bake, which was very enjoyable! We were treated to steamers, corn on the cob, baked potato &amp; of course lobster, which was sweet &amp; delicious &amp; because it is molting season, the shells were pretty soft which made for very easy eating. Apparently cooking them under seaweed helps add to the sweetness of the meat. It was a very well run affair; we did not wait long for anything &amp; the staff was very attentive.</p>

<p>We are hoping to take the family for a boat ride before the week is out, but the weather forecast does not look great. More to come later in the week.</p>
