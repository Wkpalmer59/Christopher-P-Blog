<p>Our week with the family ended with some good weather which allowed for a boat ride, swimming and some paddle boarding.</p>
<p>We left at dawn this morning to beat the wind that was forecasted to increase as the day went on. The seas were mostly calm with some swells coming in off the ocean and visibility was good until we got closer to Rockland where the fog rolled in. It was a little stressful navigating through some narrow channels that were new to us while the visibility was under a 1/4 mile.</p>

<p>We passed within a 1/4 mile of the buoy and Monroe Island pictured above.</p>
<p>Fortunately the fog lifted as we entered Rockland harbor and we were able locate the marina and get tied up safely. We will spend 2 nights here and then head to Christmas Cove.</p>
