<p>We had an uneventful run from Rockland down to Christmas Cove aside from the unpredictable on and off fog of which we are becoming quite accustomed to. The beginning of our run allowed us to see the Owl’s Head lighthouse as we left Rockland.</p>

<p>The coastline is so beautiful up here although it is unfortunate that the fog has limited our ability to see it all. So many locals have concurred to the fact that the fog this summer is uncommon for this time of year, with one lifelong local going as far as to say this year is unprecedented in how foggy &amp; wet it has been.</p>
<p>The view here in Christmas Cove is straight out of the paintings you see of Maine. We are here for two days and are hopeful to enjoy whatever fog lift we can!</p>
