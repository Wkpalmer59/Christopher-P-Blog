<h1>Christmas Cove (day 2)</h1>

<p>Even with the fog, rain and drizzle, this spot rates in the top 3 most scenic places we have visited. We were assured yet once again this morning on our walk by a local that this weather is quite unusual for July in Maine.</p>
<p>Even the cell service and internet has been a challenge, but it is kind of nice to be somewhat disconnected.</p>
<p>While the pictures and videos don’t it it justice, here is a sample. The Coveside Marina &amp; Restaurant has live bands every Saturday &amp; Sunday throughout the summer; we were moored close enough to enjoy the Happy Hour music from the comfort of our boat.</p>
<p>We especially enjoyed the frog symphony this morning!</p>
