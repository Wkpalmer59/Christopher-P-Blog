<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We had a very nice short run to South Freeport yesterday in calm waters cruising through the very scenic Casco Bay. We arrived in the early afternoon and found that we went from spring fog to summer heat and humidity, so we spent the afternoon enjoying the breeze coming off the bay.</p>

<p>Today were able to borrow the marina truck to go into downtown Freeport, visit the outlets and get some supplies.</p>
