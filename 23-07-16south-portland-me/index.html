<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We returned to Sunset Marina in South Portland as we begin to work our way south. Due to weather we will spend three nights here and then do some additional cruising in Casco bay before we head further south.</p>
<p>We got the opportunity to have lunch and spend some time with cousin Earl while we are here.</p>

<p>There is a tornado watch up for our area and some strong thunder storms are expected this afternoon, so we will spend the afternoon playing parlor games. 😊</p>
