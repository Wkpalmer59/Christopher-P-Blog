<p>Yay, we have good internet and cell service!</p>
<p>While it was somewhat nice to be off the grid, you don’t realize just how much you depend on connectivity these days.</p>
<p>We spent Monday night at Diamond Cove on Great Diamond Island. Beautiful spot (with no Wi-Fi and no cell service) and also the site of Fort McKinley. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_McKinley_(Maine)</p>
<p>We got to see some interesting sites on our morning walk.</p>

<p>On Tuesday we moved to Dolphin Marina on Basin Point. It is in a fairly quiet cove which we entered in pea soup fog. They told us our mooring was right in front of their face dock which I had to locate using the chart and radar. We were just about on top of the dock before we saw it. The picture below was taken after the fog lifted some.</p>

<p>We had a really nice dinner in the restaurant and they even brought fresh blueberry muffins out to the boat by launch in the morning.</p>
<p>We got a kick out of what they call their “harbor float”.</p>

<p>They used it during it during Covid for boats to pull up and get to go orders. It is still used when the restaurant is full and also when a group of small boats want to pull up and get food and party.</p>
