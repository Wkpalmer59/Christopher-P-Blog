<p>Today we traveled to Kennebunkport. Much of the trip was in the fog, which we are both done with! We🦞are🦞also🦞 very🦞tired🦞of🦞dodging🦞lobster🦞trap🦞buoys; it is hard to believe there are  enough lobsters out there to support all the traps and lobster boats we have seen up here!</p>
<p>This is a very pretty and small harbor with a lot of activity, even on a Wednesday.</p>
