<p>When we headed out of the Kennebunkport Harbor this morning, we took a run by the Bush compound.</p>

<p>We couldn’t get any closer due to the presidential security zone around their private peninsula, as marked on our chart plotter.</p>

<p>We had a nice run down to Kittery with no fog and a lot less lobster buoys! We will be staying here for two nights on a mooring before we head down to Gloucester. The harbor master came out to deliver welcome packet goodies and detail all amenities available to us which we look forward to checking out when we dinghy in tomorrow.</p>
