<p>This afternoon we took the dinghy across the harbor from Kittery which brought us across the state line into New Hampshire. Great old port town. We found an out of the way bar/restaurant called the  Clipper Tavern (just our kind of place!). The food was excellent and the Admiral (who considers herself to be a pickle snob) enjoyed the pickles so much she asked for some to go. What a surprise when a whole container full were delivered in person by the chef who makes them in house!</p>

<p>After lunch we walked around the town some more.</p>

<p>We then took the dinghy back to the boat past the Portsmouth Naval Base to relax and enjoy a beautiful afternoon with low humidity and no fog! Tomorrow we will head down to Gloucester.</p>
