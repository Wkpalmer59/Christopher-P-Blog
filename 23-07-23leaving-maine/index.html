<h1>Leaving Maine</h1>
<figure><img src='rs=w_1280_2cf4b.jpg'></figure>
<p>We spent the last 29 days in Maine and not ever having been here before on a boat, we learned many things! While we thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would do it again if the fates allow, we listed our pros &amp; cons below:</p>
<p>~Maine has the most beautiful coastline  that we have encountered so far…(that is when you can see it)!😊</p>
<p>~We had our fill of fog and rain. The locals kept telling us that is not normally like that in July; so many in every part of Maine that we believe them!👍</p>
<p>~There are way too many lobster trap buoys, it requires constant vigilance at the helm and it makes the autopilot almost useless.</p>
<p>~The lobster boats make running in the fog especially ‘fun‘. You pick them up on the radar but then it is impossible to tell where they are headed because they are either spinning in circles or bopping back and forth between their traps picking them up…</p>
<p>~Love/hate relationship though because the lobsters here are fabulous! Especially the soft shells; new to us &amp; so good!!</p>
<p>~Nobody gives a crap about the wake they they are throwing while passing a marina or mooring field…or even while closely passing by a boat in general!</p>
<p>~They put mooring fields in any cove, even if it wide open to the ocean. We had</p>
<p>the ‘pleasant’ experience of spending a night in one of these fields in Kittery with 2’ ocean swells rocking us awake all night!😳</p>
<p>~There are no actual liquor stores. Liquor is available in the grocery stores, which is convenient but saying they offer a minimal selection would be an understatement.</p>
<p>~Our morning walks were peppered with so many hills (some pretty steep); still deciding if this was good or bad ☺️</p>
<p>~We were amazed by how deep the waters are even close to the many islands. You could throw a rock and hit shore but still have a 100’ of water under the boat.</p>
<p>~Tides of 12 to 14 feet, which blows your mind when you think about that much water moving in and out 4 times a day! Oh &amp; the high/low tides on marina ramps=more hills😂</p>
<p>~Obviously we learned a lot more during our time here, these are just a few  highlights. Did I mention…it was absolutely beautiful!🤗</p>
