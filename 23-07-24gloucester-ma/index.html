<h1>Gloucester, MA</h1>

<p>We arrived in Gloucester yesterday and grabbed a mooring in the inner harbor.  On the way in we passed Thacher Island which has a set of twin lighthouse, something we hadn’t’t seen before.</p>

<p>We took the dinghy into the town dock which is close to downtown. We were surprised to find out that Gloucester is America‘s oldest seaport, but it certainly makes sense. We walked by the Gorton Seafood Center, and it was interesting to note that the town logo is very similar to the Gorton logo.</p>

<p>There are many old buildings with great architecture which definitely reflect an old seaport.</p>

<p>We walked by the Crow’s nest which was the bar featured in the movie “Perfect Storm”, but we did not go in for a drink.</p>
<p>Today we will take a short run down to Salem MA and see if we can find some witches.🧙🧹</p>
