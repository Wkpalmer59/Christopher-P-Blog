<p>We had a short and uneventful run to Salem yesterday and arrived in the early afternoon. Jared and May came down to the boat for a visit after work and we went to dinner at a place located right here at the marina which was nice because it was a pretty warm evening to be walking around town. It was great catching up with them…and thanks to Jared, we don’t have to lug cases of spring water onto the dinghy &amp; boat since our next destination has us on a mooring for the next few days!🤗</p>
<p>During our walk this morning we saw some of the sites including the House of the Seven Gables and the witch trial memorial site.</p>
