<p>We arrived in Scituate on Tuesday and spent the last couple of days visiting family and enjoying are old stomping gounds from when had our family get togethers here. Including our morning walks on the harbor jetty…all so very nostalgic.</p>

<p>While here, we hung out by the pool at Ray, Tenner &amp; Carols home with family, kids, neighbors, had delicious dinner &amp; was even able to get some laundry and reprovisioning done while we were here (Thanks Ray!).</p>
<p>This evening we are sitting out some strong winds and thunderstorms which are supposed to clear out so we can continue our journey in the morning. Sad we missed spending more time with family &amp; didn’t even get to make our TK O’Malley fried clam strip pilgramage.😭</p>
