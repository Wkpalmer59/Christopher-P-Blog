<p>Yesterday we traveled south through the Cape Cod Canal to one of our favorite spots in Onset MA.</p>

<p>Onset is a great spot to grab a mooring and wait for good weather to head down Buzzard’s Bay. We enjoyed a lovely sunset &amp; also got a nice visit from fellow boaters in town; Bill A. (my brothers college roommate) and his wife Mary as they passed by on their dinghy coming back from dinner in town.</p>

<p>Today we dealt with dinghy motor issues and my brother was kind enough to drive down from Raynham and pick up a new fuel pump for us along the way...thanks Don! It was great to have an extra visit with him over lunch. We then headed back to get the dinghy fixed up. Thank goodness this port has a launch service! We will spend another two nights here which is good since we now have our own transportation to go ashore on our own schedule &amp; see the town. Monday we head over to Cataumet on the Cape Cod side  of Buzzard’s Bay.</p>
