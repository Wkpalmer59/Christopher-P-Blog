<p>After confirming that we had no issues with the boat after our “fun” yesterday, we got the boat secured on a mooring and relaxed for a bit. Our friends Dave and Carey came by on their boat and tied along side and we enjoyed a beautiful afternoon onboard the Christopher P. Late afternoon we had a fun ride back to their marina on their boat and then drove back to their house on Scraggy Neck to enjoy another awesome dinner featuring fresh clams &amp; oysters for appetizers. They are friends with an aquaculturist that farms them locally &amp; we have never had fresher/tastier😋</p>
<p>So spoiled…thanks guys!</p>

<p>We will spend one more night here on the mooring before we head over to New Bedford where we will leave the boat for the weekend to drive back to Milford for Pam and Joey’s last annual flamingo/lobster bake.🦩🦞</p>
