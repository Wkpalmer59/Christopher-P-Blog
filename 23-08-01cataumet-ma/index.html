<p>Yesterday we had a beautiful morning in Onset. In fact it was so nice we went for a walk, had a leisurely breakfast, did some paddle boarding and decided to have lunch before heading to our next destination as it was a short ride. Well it turns out we should have left earlier as the wind came up strong out of the southwest in Buzzards Bay and with the current coming out of the canal the waves were standing up. The Christopher P handled it well, but we did get tossed around enough to knock some things off the shelves in the galley and we took a lot of spray, especially IN the the forward head where an open hatch was missed while battening down hatches.</p>
<p>When we got to Kingman Yacht Center they gave us our slip assignment which was all the way in on their inside basin, which is very tight.</p>

<p>As we were maneuvering in I realized that the boat across from us was sticking pretty far out so I had to go further in the get enough room to spin around and back into the slip. The wind was still blowing pretty good and it was pushing me towards the boats on the other side. Not normally a big deal with the twin engines and bow thruster. However, when I put the starboard engine in reverse to pull the stern around in to the slip, it made a horrible noise and then stalled. Without knowing what was wrong I didn’t want to try and restart it, so we slowly drifted towards the rocks at the end of the basin and against the last boat on the other side.</p>

<p>Fortunately by using the port engine and the bow thruster I was able to slow us down even more so the bow rested against the shore and we put a fender between us and the other boat. The marina was able to bring their work boat around and tow us into the slip with the help of the bow thruster.</p>
<p>Once we got tied up, I noticed this:</p>

<p>Evidently the aft spring line that was staged for our docking fell over the side and got wrapped around the starboard prop. I contacted Boat US, and they said they could send a diver to remove the line and check the running gear, but they couldn’t get there until after 6pm. I told them we were planning to have dinner with friends and they said that wasn’t a problem. They called later that evening, said the line was removed and everything checked out good and it was all covered under my gold membership. Win!</p>
<p>We left the slip this morning to move to a mooring and ran the boat up to speed and all is well!</p>
<p>Today we are going the hang out with Dave and Carey again and when we remember to do a selfie with them we will do another post.😊</p>
