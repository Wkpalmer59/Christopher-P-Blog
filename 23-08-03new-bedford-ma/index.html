<p>We left Cataumet early this morning in order to avoid the strong winds forecast for the afternoon. It was a nice ride and we got in just as the winds really started to pick up, and good thing as it is blowing pretty good now.</p>
<p>New Bedford is the only Harbor that we have been in that has a massive hurricane barrier to protect against storms and storm surge. They can close it up and fully protect the harbor from a storm surge. Amazing!</p>

<p>It was great to be able to spend so much time with our good friends Dave and Carey. The fresh oysters, clams &amp; stuffed clams were the best along with all the other food we consumed courtesy of chef Carey at their “Canya Diner“…</p>
<p>(Dave-ism: “Honey, can ya make something for dinner”)</p>
