<p>On Friday we traveled from Essex to Port Jeff. It was a little sloppy out on the sound but it was a following sea so it was tolerable. When we arrived we were surprised at how empty the mooring field was, but it has gradually filled in and it is party full now. Here are videos of the before and after.</p>

<p>The weather has been perfect and we have been able to take walks on the beach in the morning where we rescued a horseshoe crab and ran across an Ospray enjoying his breakfast.</p>

<p>We enjoyed some float time after acclimating ourselves to the cold ass northern waters🥶</p>

<p>We have been experiencing quite a bit of Tom foolishness including random gun shots at 1:30 in the morning and new and interesting ways to float around the bay.</p>

<p>Yesterday we took the dinghy into town and had lunch at Billies 1890 saloon. I did some math while we were there and figured out that I have been visiting Billies by boat for over 47 years. 😳</p>

<p>We then went to the Port Jeff brewery for dessert…a banana porter😉</p>
<p>We also need to acknowledge the passing of an icon……. Rest in Paradise Jimmy! Thank you for providing the sound track for many of our boating adventures. I hope you do find that heaven has a beach attached...fins up!</p>
<p>On Tuesday we will head over to Milford where we will spend some time getting work done on the boat and restocking. In September we look forward to celebrating our 39th wedding anniversary, attending a family VT wedding &amp; then heading out to Seattle to visit Kait &amp; Pat!! After all of that, we will be heading back to Florida end of September. Cannot believe how quickly this summer sped by!!</p>
