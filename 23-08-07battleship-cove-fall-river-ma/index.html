<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>In case you haven’t heard another way, Pam and Joe‘s lobster bake party on Saturday was actually their wedding instead which was held in their back yard with a reception at a local restaurant. It was a beautiful ceremony officiated by our good friend Ryan, and we had a great party with all our closest friends in attendance. Even Clark and Susan from Florida, the Glista family from Georgia &amp;  the Yokovich family from Texas traveled from afar for the</p>
<p>“final 🦞🦩bake”!!</p>
<p>The bride and groom drove back to the boat with us yesterday and will spend the next 10 days cruising on the Love Boat 💞( I mean Christopher P) 😉.</p>
<p>We left New Bedford this morning and as we left the harbor we had to move off to the the side and let a rather large ship get through the hurricane barrier.</p>

<p>Unfortunately our plans to go to Edgartown and Oak Bluffs on the Vineyard got blown up by the weather. There is a system coming through that has high winds so we changed our plans and headed to the more protected waters in Narragansett Bay.</p>
<p>We arrived in Battleship Cove just before lunch and will spend the next two days on a mooring. Here is our current view: https://youtu.be/uWen6UxSirw</p>
<p>So cocktails &amp; parlor games on this rainy day. Tomorrow we will dinghy in to be tourists.📸</p>
