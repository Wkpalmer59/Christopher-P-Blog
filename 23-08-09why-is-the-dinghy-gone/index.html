<h1>Why’s The Dinghy Gone?!😳</h1>
<p>This morning we got up and got ready to go ashore for our morning walk and when I went to the stern to warm up the dinghy, I discovered it was missing. My first thought was that it came untied, but with the way the wind was blowing it would have ended up on shore. We searched with the binoculars and it was no where in sight. At that point we are thinking it was stolen, which is a little creepy since the Admiral and I were sleeping in the aft cabin.</p>
<p>We then called the harbormaster, who is also a police officer, to report it stolen. He came out a little while later in his boat and did a cruise around the cove and was unable to locate it, so he came aboard and we filled out all the paperwork.</p>
<p>During the wait for him to arrive we are thinking about the impact of this. Not only does it screw up plans to stay at anchor or on a mooring, I was thinking about the logistics for acquiring a new dinghy and motor and rigging it out with everything needed to carry it on the platform. What a major pain in the butt &amp; our summer travel plans would need to be cut short to deal with it all.</p>
<p>Once the paperwork was complete, I stood up as the harbormaster  was preparing to leave and suddenly saw the dinghy bobbing near the shore behind where the fire boat was tied up. It must have drifted in behind the fire boat and the wind shifted while we were doing paperwork and it floated back out. Whew!</p>
<p>So we have determined that the Captain needs to go back to knot tieing school. And of course this had to happen when our friend Pam is onboard; if you know her, you know she is never going to let me hear the end of it. In my defense, it was quite windy last night and the boat was sawing back and forth quite a bit which evidently caused the knots (clove hitch followed by a 1/2 hitch) to work loose.</p>
<p>Here are a couple videos of the dinghy retrieval process which of course were taken by Pam.</p>

<p>Oh, and in case you didn’t get it, the title of this post is a reference to “Why’s the rum gone?“ which has also been attributed to the Captain in the past.</p>
