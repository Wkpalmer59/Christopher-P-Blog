<p>We left Warwick yesterday to head over to East Greenwich. We only had a few miles to do so we took our time and started to cruise one of the other local harbors. Around noon time the wind started to pick up and there were some storms predicted for the afternoon, so we decided to head over to the marina where we had a reservation. Check-in time is usually 1pm for most marinas but we have arrived early many times at other marinas without a problem. We arrived off the marina’s docks shortly after 12pm and tried hailing them on the radio on their designated channel but got no response. I then tried calling their phone number and no one answered. After a few minutes of trying the radio and phone again with no luck, we found an open spot at the end of one of the docks and tied up temporarily until we could find someone to tell us where we were supposed to go. I walked up to the office which was locked up with the lights off. I figured maybe they were just out to lunch so I went back to the boat to wait until 1pm to try again. Shortly thereafter I got a text from Alex, and this is how it went.</p>

<p>So we made ourselves at home and are being very careful not to damage the dock.…really???!!! I don’t usually leave reviews (good or bad) but I am going to leave one for this marina.</p>
<p>As usual we got a history lesson on our morning walk. This is a great small town with a rich history.</p>
