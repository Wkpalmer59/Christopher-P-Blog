<p>We ran over to Block Island yesterday in fairly calm seas. We were unable to find a mooring which are first come first serve, but we were told by the harbormaster that if we contacted them at 2pm they would get us on a private mooring &amp; we should just anchor in the meantime. So we did just that. Fast forward to 2 pm~upon contacting them, we realized what they failed to tell us earlier was that we needed to have the boat in a special meeting spot at 2pm (along with all the other boats we heard on the radio also requesting a mooring). We would’ve been very late to the party.🙄 Turns out we found a good anchorage spot and our anchor is holding well, even during the storm we had early this morning.</p>
