<p>We started our day yesterday with a dinghy ride over to “dinghy” beach in the</p>
<p>Great Salt Pond, and then a short walk over to the state beach on the east side of the island. We took a nice long walk on the beach and the Admiral was happy to get her beach fix.</p>

<p>Around noon time we headed to shore in the launch and took a cab over to Old Harbor where the ferries come in. We did some shopping and then began a bar crawl as we worked our way back to New Harbor. We hit 9 bars along the way.</p>
<p>1. The Harbor Grill, 2. The Mohegan, 3. The National Hotel, 4. The Surf Hotel, 5. The Yellow Kittens, 6. Captain Nicks, 7. Poor Peoples Pub, 8. Mahogany Shoals, 9. The Oar where we finished with delicious mudslides. Below are the pictures from our first and last stop.</p>

<p>Good thing we took the launch so the captain didn’t have to pilot the dinghy back to the boat.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will take the honeymooners over to Mystic where they will catch a train home.</p>
