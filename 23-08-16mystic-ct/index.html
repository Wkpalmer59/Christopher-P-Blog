<p>We left Block Island this morning and traveled to Mystic where the honeymooners were picked up by Pam’s sister. We‘ll miss you Mr. &amp; Mrs.!!🤵👰‍♀️ We forgot to take a departure selfie, so you will just have to imagine it. 😊</p>
<p>We did see this rather large blue crab swimming near the dock as we walked up.</p>
