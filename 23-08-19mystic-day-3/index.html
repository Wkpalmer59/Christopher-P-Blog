<h1>Mystic (Day 3)</h1>

<p>We spent our first two nights in Mystic at the Safe Harbor marina, then moved to Seaport Marine. This is the marina that had the big fire last November and we spotted this I-beam in the empty lot where the building used to be. Looks like it was a pretty hot fire.</p>

<p>We tried to get a spot at the Seaport museum, but they were full, so last evening we took a dinghy ride by the docks to see some of the ships. Very cool.</p>

<p>Today we went to the grocery and liquor stores to re-stock for the next couple of weeks, then we took a walk through downtown Mystic so the Admiral could do some window shopping.</p>
