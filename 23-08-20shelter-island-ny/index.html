<h1>Shelter Island, NY</h1>
<p>We had an uneventful ride from Mystic over to Long Island. Got a little bumpy as we traveled  through The Race: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_Rock_Light</p>
<p>Hard to believe that 6-8 feet of the water in Long Island Sound flows out and back in through the race and East River twice a day, hence the reason why the currents are so strong and can create some nasty conditions. Fortunately it was fairly calm today and we caught it close to slack tide.</p>
<p>We planned to stay here at anchor another night but may move on if the weather forecast changes.</p>
