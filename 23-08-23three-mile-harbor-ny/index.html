<p>Today we moved to Three Mile Harbor which has long been one of our favorite spots. We spent an extra day in Shelter Island to wait out some high winds, but enjoyed it there as well. We did some paddle boarding in the calm waters and found a nice beach to take walks on where the Admiral was able to collect some beautiful shells and sea glass too. It was pretty cool to discover that some of those beauties hadn’t been vacated; they were lucky they got thrown back!</p>

<p>We also caught some nice sunsets.</p>

<p>We plan to stay here until Sunday when we will move to a marina in Greenport for a couple of nights.</p>
