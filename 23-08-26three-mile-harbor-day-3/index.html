<h1>Three Mile Harbor (Day 3)</h1>

<p>We have been sitting on the hook here in Three Mile Harbor since Wednesday. We found a good dinghy dock in the harbor where we could get ice and go for walks. There is even a small market that is quite a busy morning stop with many locals getting coffee &amp; breakfast.</p>
<p>This morning we came across a beautiful old yacht that was built in 1937. It is amazingly well maintained. You can check out some more photos here: https://www.yatco.com/yachts/flying-lady-trumpy-1937-206083/</p>

<p>We had a stormy day yesterday so we just hunkered down in the cabin and played parlor games, enjoyed cocktails and binge watched Lincoln Lawyer on Netflix.</p>
<p>Today is a beautiful day so we took the dinghy over to the north end of the harbor and took a walk on the beach.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will head over to Greenport and get a slip in a marina for two days so we can fill our water tanks, give the batteries a good charge, and re-supply.</p>
