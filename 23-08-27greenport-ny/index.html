<p>Today we traveled a whole 12 nautical miles from Three Mile Harbor to Greenport. After 7 days anchored, we are tied up at the Townsend Manor Marina with basic amenities we’ve grown to appreciate such as water &amp; WIFI!! This particular marina is tucked into the head of the harbor and away from the craziness of downtown, but we are still only a 1/2 mile walk to downtown. It is a nice spot with a great view and a lovely breeze coming in off the water.</p>

<p>We took a walk into town &amp; stopped in at the Greenport Brewery which is right next to the old jail and also the Stidd factory that built the captains chair on the Christopher P.</p>
