<p>On Sunday in Greenport we were looking for a place to have dinner but were disgusted by the outrageous prices being charged in the downtown restaurants, so we took the dinghy across the harbor and found a little local restaurant with a live band that was great and the food was reasonably priced.</p>
<p>Today we traveled across Long Island Sound and up the Connecticut River to Essex. We dealt with a little fog but the seas were calm. Had to communicate with a couple of ferries on the radio as we came through Plum Gut. https://www.thefisherman.com/hot-spot/plum-gut/</p>
<p>Once we got settled on our mooring we took a walk into town and took in some of the sights.</p>

<p>We will spend two nights on a mooring here and then move to Essex Island Marina for one night before we head to Port Jefferson for Labor Day Weekend.</p>
