<p>On Wednesday we took another walk into town and visited the Connecticut River museum where we learned all about the history of the River including the raid on Essex by the British during the war of 1812.</p>

<p>They also had a replica and working model of the submarine Turtle. https://ctrivermuseum.org/turtle-submarine/</p>
<p>Yesterday we moved to the marina to recharge and fill water tanks and then went for an early dinner at the Black Seal. Below are pictures of the infamous porthole. They had to block it off because the local fire department got tired of getting people unstuck. Apparently Shelly Mack was the one that got it started in 2004.</p>

<p>We then went back to the boat and caught the tail end of a concert on the dock at the museum. https://youtu.be/mCFkj1oS_QY</p>
<p>There were a bunch of people in dinghies enjoying it as well.</p>
