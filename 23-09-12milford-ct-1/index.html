<p>We arrived in Milford last Tuesday and have been busy with boat projects, appointments and visiting  friends and family.</p>
<p>On Tuesday we got a visit from Admiral’s cousin Janet, nephew Dan and his girlfriend Ly who traveled all the way from Vietnam! We look forward to spending more time with them this coming weekend!</p>

<p>On Friday we celebrated our 39th wedding anniversary with some good friends &amp; family on the boat. On Saturday we took the Admiral’s 84 year old stepfather for a ride on the boat which he thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>Then on Sunday we took our good friend Robin, her mom Ellie, and her aunt Joan out to deliver a martini to Joan’s husband Mead whose ashes were spread in Long Island sound. Mead was an avid sailor and raced his Star sailboat out of Milford yacht club. We had to cut our trip short due to impending thunderstorms and instead delivered the martini just off the yacht club dock where legend has it that Mead had enjoyed many a martini or two.🍸😉</p>
<p>Here is a brief history of Mead along with a tribute. See the last two pages. https://starclass.org/assets/documents/octobernewsletter_(1).pdf</p>
<p>We moved off the boat to the condo today so Milford Boat Works can get necessary engine work done, then haul the boat for bottom paint &amp; zincs before our journey back down south.🌴</p>
