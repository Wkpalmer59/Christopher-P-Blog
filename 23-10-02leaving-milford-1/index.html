<h1>Leaving Milford</h1>

<p>Wow, what a whirlwind! The last couple of weeks have been a little crazy. We cleaned out the fridge, packed ourselves a bag and moved off the boat so routine maintenance work could be completed and then drove to VT for our niece’s wedding which was beautiful.</p>

<p>When we got back we did some refinishing on some of the wood in the cabin on the boat along with some other projects. We then flew to Seattle to visit Kait &amp; Pat. We had a great time out there visiting them and some pretty cool touristy places as well. They were very fun hosts &amp; we enjoyed meeting our adorable Daisy look alike grandpup Penny.</p>

<p>When we returned, the marina put the boat back in the water on Wednesday and we spent the last few rainy days closing up the condo, moving back on the boat and stocking up for our trip south.</p>

<p>On Saturday we went to Pam and Joey’s for a barbecue which gave us a great opportunity to enjoy a final visit with our friends before heading south. We thought we would have already been gone, but due to the bad weather, this was a silver lining. Sunday at the marina was pretty quiet but we did enjoy some reminiscing and rum time with our old next door boat neighbor Bob…why’s the rum gone?</p>
<p>And in conclusion, a special shout out to our personal Uber drivers and introductory wine sommelier, you helped make our return easier….thanks Ry, Rob &amp; Alex!</p>

<p>We shoved off this morning and and and are currently enjoying a nice calm day in Long Island sound. We are heading for Port Washington where we will pick up a mooring for the night.</p>
