<p>Yesterday we left early to make our way down through the east river and out to the Jersey coast. It was a very calm day and we only had to contend with some ocean swells left over from all the recent storms. it is always fun to travel through the city and see all the sights. We decIded it is definitely more fun to go under the Whitestone bridge then it is to go over it on the way to the airport.</p>

<p>This morning we took a walk out to the Point Pleasant boardwalk and beach. We had no idea this was such a summer hot spot with a judge boardwalk and beau beach.</p>
