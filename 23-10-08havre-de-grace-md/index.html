<p>We arrived in Havre de Grace on Friday after a long day with the current against us in the Delaware Bay and C&amp;D canal. We were looking for a new and interesting place to sit out some nasty weather and we found it. This is a great town with lots of history and things to do.</p>

<p>The town was also burned down by the British during the revolutionary war in 1777.</p>
<p>We learned that Havre de Grace almost became out nation’s capital over Washington and only lost by a tie breaking vote of the speaker of the house in 1799.</p>
<p>There is a great park for our morning walks with monuments and art displays.</p>

<p>There is even a great brewery a block from the marina with a good selection of beer, good views and live music.</p>

<p>The weather through Monday is not great so we plan to stay here until, hopefully, Tuesday when we will head down to the Hole in the Wall Maryland camp.</p>
