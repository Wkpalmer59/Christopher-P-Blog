<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Just getting to our latest post this morning due to a lack of internet access during our stay at Hole in the Wall.</p>
<p>We departed Havre de Grace on Tuesday and enjoyed a beautiful sunrise.</p>

<p>We arrived at the dock at the camp around 3pm which is about 8 miles up the Wye East River. It is a nice quiet and secluded spot.</p>
<p>I spent Wednesday doing a walk through at the camp to gather info for the planned phone deployment.</p>
<p>We departed early this morning with a bon voyage at the dock from Pete and Paul and are currently headed for the Solomons.</p>
