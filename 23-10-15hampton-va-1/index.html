<p>We spent a couple of days here in Hampton getting in a visit with our good friend Malcolm and hashing out some old times while waiting as some weather to passed through.💦☔️💦He was gracious enough to tote us around to get some resupply errands done and even came up with the $0.37 we needed at West Marine to cover the cost of some hose clamps after using our rewards. 😊</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will enter the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AICW) with a stop in Coinjock for our much anticipated prime rib.</p>
