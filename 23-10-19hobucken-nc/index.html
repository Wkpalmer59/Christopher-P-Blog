<p>We decided to try a new spot last night that we have passed many times...holy Hobucken!😳</p>
<p>This time we decided to stop there mostly because it was almost exactly half way between the Alligator River and Beaufort where we are headed today. It was basically just a dock to tie up to with no power or water, but the price was right at $0.40 per foot. There was a promise of fresh seafood, but they just had some frozen stuff.</p>

<p>We found out after we arrived that the pirates had invaded.</p>

<p>Tonight we will stay in Beaufort and visit with our friends Don and Vicky and then tomorrow we will see cousin Kara and her husband Steve.</p>
