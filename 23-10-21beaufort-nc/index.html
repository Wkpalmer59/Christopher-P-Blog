<p>We stayed in Beaufort for three nights and had a fun visit with good friends Don and Vicky as well as cousin Kara and Steve with whom we always enjoy catching up with! And yes, we are losers (aka had too much fun🥳) and forgot to get selfies with both couples.🙄</p>
<p>We stayed an extra night due to pretty windy conditions.  It even got a little sporty here in this marina. Can‘t tell from this video, but our ramp was quite a challenge to traverse before we even went out for cocktails!</p>

<p>Our morning walks often provide us with something interesting and this morning we came upon a classic car show with a lot of great cars.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will continue our migration south seeking warmer weather as they are forecasting lows in the 50s here.🥶</p>
