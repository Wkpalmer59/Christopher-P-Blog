<p>We did a quick overnight at a quiet marina in Hampstead. Nothing to do there but it was well protected from the wind and we had good internet. It was also a very convenient spot to get a pump out, which of course is important.😉💩</p>
<p>Today we took a short run down to Carolina Beach. It is finally starting to feel as though we are getting closer to our southern goal as we wear shorts &amp; tees during the day &amp; are finally beginning to see playful dolphins and palm trees.☀️🐬🌴</p>

<p>Yes, dolphins in the wake never gets old. 😊</p>
<p>We picked up a mooring in another quiet spot with easy beach access and plan on staying here two nights.</p>
