<p>This is one of our favorite stops on the waterway, but we couldn’t stay longer due to the fact we are booked in Brunswick for the 1st and we have some weather coming in on Tuesday.</p>
<p>We did get the chance to go to a favorite Mexican restaurant for dinner and got a nice walk in this morning.</p>

<p>Today we are going to an off the grid location we found in the spring that breaks up the trip from Beaufort to Brunswick. We also need to make a bridge that has some restrictions due to a demolition project.</p>
