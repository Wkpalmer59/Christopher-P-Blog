<p>We arrived at Brunswick Landing Marina yesterday afternoon after a ‘fun‘ ride in the fog until about 10am. It got frighteningly thick at times….so bad even our eyelashes &amp; hair were wet 😳 Thanks to good electronics and a previous track to follow we got through it safely.</p>

<p>We also experienced a first. When conditions are right, sunlight mixing with fog can cause a beautiful natural phenomena known as a fogbow!</p>

<p>This will be our home for the month of November as we wait out the remainder of hurricane season before continuing on to Cocoa. As you can see from the picture at the top, this is a huge marina in the heart of downtown Brunswick. As it is known to be a ‘hurricane hole’ many boaters wait out hurricane season here and use it as a staging point before heading to the islands. It has a great community feel and they host socials three times a week in the club house with free beer and wine.</p>

<p>It is also a prime sunset location. We should not have any trouble enjoying our time here.</p>
