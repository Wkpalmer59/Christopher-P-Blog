<p>We been here in Brunswick now for 2 weeks and the sunsets have not disappointed. We get spectacular ones at least 2-3 times a week.</p>

<p>We took a dinghy ride around the marina to check out all the other boat names and hailing ports which is always fun. We did see this one that tied up behind us and felt it was a good one to share. Look closely at the dinghy name.</p>

<p>We have been enjoying some of the local events and restaurants and today we plan to go to Porchfest and then visit the Silver Bluffs Brewery.</p>

<p>When in Georgia… we got some local flavor including an old favorite, boiled peanuts. And we were pleasantly surprised by Dat Sauce! We also got some pecans which are the best!😋</p>
<p>We are here until the end of the month, at which time we will travel up to the Georgia Blue Ridge mountains to spend Thanksgiving at our friends, John and Kelly’s new abode.</p>
