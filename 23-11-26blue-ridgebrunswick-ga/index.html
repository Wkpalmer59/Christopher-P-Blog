<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>On Wednesday we took a short flight from Brunswick to Atlanta and then drove up to the Blue Ridge Mountains to spend Thanksgiving with our good friends John and Kelly at their new home. We had a great time with their family (92 years young Aunt Stella was a hoot) and we also got to enjoy time with our good friends from back home, Pam and Joey.</p>
<p>We returned to the boat in Brunswick on Friday to do some final preparations before we head south to Cocoa on Monday. We will be glad to move on as we have been dealing with the noise from a dredge that has been working in the harbor 24/7 for the past week.</p>
<p>Click this link below to see a view of the dredge from the town dock to get an idea of its size and the noise!</p>

<p>Here is another video taken from our boat so you can see how close it got a one point.</p>

<p>We were treated to yet another great sunset when we returned on Friday; we will miss these.</p>

<p>Our first stop will be Amelia Island where we will hopefully get some relatively cheap fuel and then we will move on to St. Augustine.</p>
