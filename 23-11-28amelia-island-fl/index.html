<p>We arrived in Amelia Island at Fernandina Beach Marina after a brief stop for cheap fuel. As we have been here many times, we opted not to go into town &amp; instead enjoyed a relaxing night on the boat. We were once again treated to a lovely sunset which continued to get even more colorful long after the sun disappeared. It did get quite sporty during the night due to strong winds. We awoke to a very chilly temperature of 49🥶 Picture below was taken on our morning jaunt. We will continue moving south until we arrive to where the weather suits our clothes.</p>
