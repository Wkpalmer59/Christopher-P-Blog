<p>Clark and I finished the trip to Cocoa stopping in Daytona on Wednesday and then continuing on to Cocoa on Thursday where we were greeted at the dock by our lovely ladies🥰🥰</p>
<p>(📸 cred  to Clark)</p>
<p>We are now settled in at Cocoa Village Marina which will be our home for the next couple of months. There are some local Christmas celebrations we hope enjoy this weekend &amp; next before we head home to celebrate with family &amp; friends. In the mean time, we will keep busy doing projects on the boat and prepping for Christmas in Connecticut🎄</p>
