<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Just a quick update.</p>
<p>Since we arrived in Cocoa in early December we have seen a couple of rocket launches and also got to see the annual boat parade, which goes right past our marina.</p>

<p>And of course we have spent some time with our friends Clark and Susan.</p>

<p>We flew home for the holidays on December 14th and had a great time visiting with family and friends.</p>

<p>Our last evening in CT we enjoyed a fun night having a few cocktails with Ryan and Robin while they waited for the cable guy.</p>

<p>We are now back on the boat, reaquainting with previous neighbors &amp; meeting some new ones. There is even another Mainship 430 on our dock this season! In the meantime, we are getting a lot of projects and upgrades done. We are expecting some friends &amp; family visits during January &amp; early February. After seeing them off, we plan to continue our travels heading down to the Keys mid February. Please check back then and we will get back to our regularly scheduled programming. 🌴☀️</p>
