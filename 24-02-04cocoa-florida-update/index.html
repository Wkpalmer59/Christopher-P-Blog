<h1>Cocoa Florida - Update</h1>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We have been enjoying our time here in Cocoa, even though the weather has not been typical for January. It is still better than being up north in the cold though. 😊</p>
<p>We had a few out of town friends visit during January. Pam and Joe arrived &amp; stayed with local mutual friends Clark and Susan. John and Kelly also visited at the same time staying with us on the boat. We were able to all get together for a few happy hours &amp; fabulous dinners at Clark and Susan’s.</p>

<p>There were also a few drinks consumed on the Christopher P which resulted in Clark and John deciding (the next day of course) that it’s probably in their best interest not to drink this particular booze together anymore.</p>

<p>After that group moved on, Adrienne’s brother Ed joined us on the boat for a few nights to celebrate Adrienne’s birthday🥳 Fun fact, they are both the same age for most of February until it is his birthday. He now owns my old Camaro so I had a chance to take it for a ride while he was here.</p>

<p>After Ed left we enjoyed the rest of the beautiful day enjoying sunshine &amp; cocktails on the bow.</p>

<p>We are currently hunkered down in the cabin doing a few of our never ending projects then relaxing while it rains on my birthday. (Full disclosure; the weather was perfect yesterday during my birthday weekend, so I did get to enjoy that)!</p>
<p>We are here for a couple more weeks and then will head down to the Keys.</p>
