<p>This first picture is what the view usually looks like from the bow of our boat on most days. Starting last night though, we had a storm and cold front come through that is kicking up gale force winds off shore and is gusting a good 30-35 knots here in the Indian River. As you can see, during a northerly blow we are pretty exposed in our slip so it is pretty sporty here today. Fortunately this is forecast to lay down overnight tonight and we will be back to calm sunny weather by the weekend. Here are a couple of videos that show what is it currently like, but I don’t think they really do it justice.</p>

<p>The Christopher P is a big girl and we have her tied down well, so we just need to ride it out until tomorrow and hopefully all will be fine. A little alcohol might be in order to help drown out the wind and wave noise and help facilitate some sleep tonight. 🥴😴</p>
