<h1>Cocoa, FL - Rocket Launch</h1>

<p>One of the perks of our spot here in Cocoa is that we have a pretty good view of the rocket launches from Cape Canaveral. This particular launch was a Space-X Falcon 9 with a classified payload of satellites for the USSF. This one was fun because the booster lands back at the base rather than out on a drone ship so we can see it come back down and we also get a sonic boom. I was able to get some great pictures with the nice camera and good zoom lens my daughter Kait &amp; her fiancé Pat bought me for Christmas (thanks Kait &amp; Pat)!</p>

<p>We have decided to stay here in Cocoa until the end of February at which time we will start heading down to the Keys.</p>
