<p>We extended our time here in Cocoa when we realized Kait &amp; Pat’s cross country travel from Seattle, WA would coincide with their arrival in our area early March. They joined us on the boat for a few nights &amp; midweek they rented an Airbnb down by Cocoa beach at which point April flew in from CT to join us for a long weekend. It sure made for a whirlwind last week here!</p>
<p>Penny got to experience boat life for a few days. She did very well aside from being a bit off put when anyone had the nerve to create a wake &amp; rock her world on their way by! The timing of their arrival was great too as they were also able to witness from the bow 2 rocket launches, one of which was manned with a crew.</p>

<p>The Airbnb was great! It had plenty of amenities for a comfortable stay and was a short walk to the beach, so we had a few relaxing beach days. The weather was nice, the kids swam &amp; enjoyed romping in the waves. We took a boat ride one day to try to &amp; find some playful dolphins that would race alongside the boat in our wake. We did see some, but as luck would have it, they were lazy ones. We also watched a lot pelicans face plant the water trying to grab fish.</p>

<p>While we grilled or cooked most nights, we did want to go to a local Thai restaurant we enjoy in the Village, after which we headed out for a walk &amp; were sucked into the shenanigans going on at the local German Bier Garten.</p>

<p>There were table games, beer drinking contests &amp; Kait even tried her hand playing the alphorn, the largest instrument in the world, measuring 8 feet!</p>

<p>Today begins the first leg of our journey down to the keys where we hope to do some snorkeling, paddle boarding &amp; dinghy exploring. It was a little melancholy saying so many “until we see you again” to family &amp; friends, including our Florida ‘besties’ Clark &amp; Susan who sent us on our way with a well thought out parting gift of yummy libations &amp; an ode to our Florida days spent together with our favorite chips!  Thank you friends! 🥰</p>
