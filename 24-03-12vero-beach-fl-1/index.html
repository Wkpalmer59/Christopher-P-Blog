<p>We had an uneventful trip from Cocoa to Vero yesterday with a stiff breeze on our stern which made it a little challenging getting tied up when we arrived at the city marina around 3:30. We woke up to a nice quiet morning and took a walk in the local park along the waterway, which has many sections dedicated to veterans of different wars and to all who sacrificed some and some who sacrificed all. The town is obviously grateful to veterans by the all the different memorials, flags, statues &amp; general maintenance of the park. It is truly beautiful!🇺🇸</p>
