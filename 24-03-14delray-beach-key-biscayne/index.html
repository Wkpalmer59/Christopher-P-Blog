<h1>Delray Beach &amp; Key Biscayne</h1>

<p>We have had two fairly long days. We left Jensen Beach early after a sunrise walk on Wednesday. We stopped for fuel along the way and tied up in Delray. We stayed at the city marina which is a new stop for us. We took a walk through town to Publix in the morning and found it to be a beautiful town. Our plan for our return will be stop back there and spend two nights to explore some more.</p>
<p>Today we left Delray around 9am and travelled through Ft Lauderdale and Miami where we had to deal with many yahoos that don’t understand general courtesy and also had to wait for quite a few bridges that run on schedules. Bridge tenders must also be frustrated with dealing with the yahoos we encountered as many of them were quite salty, dripping with sarcasm and a few even resorting to yelling at them over the radio😳</p>

<p>We passed by a massive amount of opulence and “stupid money” in Palm Beach, Ft Lauderdale and Miami. Never ceases to amaze us.</p>

<p>We also got to see some silliness.</p>

<p>And of course Miami is just crazy.</p>

<p>We are now in a relatively quiet anchorage (only because it is not the weekend) with a great view of the Miami skyline.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will head down to Key Largo where we plan to chill for a couple days.</p>
