<p>We arrived in Key Largo on Friday afternoon and dropped anchor in Blackwater Sound where we were treated to a beautiful sunset.</p>

<p>We have had fun using the new camera Kait and Pat bought us for Christmas allowing us to capture some shots that just don&#39;t come out with a phone.</p>
<p>On Saturday we traveled down to Snake Creek passage to get to the ocean side so we could try and do some snorkeling on the reefs. Along the way we had a group of dolphins play in the wake for quite a while and the Admiral was able to capture some nice action shots.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the wind has been blowing out of the southeast for the last few days and it was just a little too choppy on the outside to try and grab one of the public moorings and get in the water. We went back to the bay side and anchored by Windley Key for the night. Since it is the weekend we had quite a few boats and jet skis buzzing back and forth, some rather close, but things settled down after sunset and we had a nice quiet evening.</p>
<p>The water is beautiful down here, but also very shallow with some narrow channels, so we have to be alert and watch the charts. The depth alarm also goes off quite often.</p>

<p>Today we plan to move back up to Blackwater Sound where we will anchor for tonight. We’ll launch the dinghy and head to our friends John &amp; Kellys old stomping grounds, The Caribbean Club to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day with a cocktail.🍹☘️</p>
