<h1>Leaving The Keys</h1>
<figure><img src='rs=w_1280_07daa.jpg'></figure>
<p>We originally planned to stay down in the keys for another few days, but after checking the weather we saw that a storm is coming through over the weekend and will bring a lot of wind and rain, so we decided to head back early and get into the waterway north of Miami before the storm comes through.</p>
<p>Although we didn&#39;t get a chance to go snorkeling, we did enjoy several quiet days at anchor enjoying the sunsets and beautiful water. To celebrate St. Patrick&#39;s day we anchored off the Caribbean Club and took the dinghy in to have a couple of drinks and enjoy a great band with an awesome singer. Here is a video of our arrival taken by the Admiral:</p>

<p>We spent the last two days tied up at the Anchorage Resort and Yacht Club in Key Largo where there is a great restaurant. (The Blackwater Siren)</p>
<p>We were also entertained by some dolphins, pelicans and other vocal birds right in our ’backyard’. We were entertained watchingTow Boat US raise a derelict boat for salvage.</p>

<p>Today we are anchored off Key Biscayne and will stay here for the night. Tomorrow we will make the slow run up the waterway through Miami and Ft. Lauderdale and we will tie up in a marina near Hillsboro Inlet to ride out the storm.🌊💨🌨️</p>
