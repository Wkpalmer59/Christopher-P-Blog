<p>We were able to get out of The Keys before the storm rolled in and got tied up in a marina in Lighthouse Point. On the way up we saw Mark Zuckerberg’s new mega yacht. https://pagesix.com/2024/03/21/lifestyle/see-mark-zuckerbergs-new-300m-287-foot-superyacht-launchpad/</p>

<p>We arrived on Thursday and it did get pretty windy and rainy, so we were glad we were tied up in a well protected marina. The neighborhood is beautiful &amp; the homes are very well maintained &amp; exude wealth (we saw 5 *Porsches parked on the street right outside of the marina).</p>

<p>While here we saw this sign on the piling for the boat next to us. We met the owner who thought something was wrong with his gas lines until he realized it was being stolen; he caught a local 30 something year old that still lives at home &amp; daddy only allowed him 1 full gas tank per month in their boat, so he would pull their boat up to the slip we are currently in &amp; siphon his starboard tank dry!</p>
