<p>Yesterday we officially started The Great Loop as we passed the buoy above. This marks where we will ”cross our wake”. As seen in the chart below, this buoy (circled) is located where the St. Lucie River (on the left) and the Intracoastal Waterway (bottom to top) intersect. We ran the waterway up from the keys and passed this spot where we officially began the loop. This is because when we finish the loop, we come across Florida and will pass this same spot as we come out on the St Lucie River. Hence the term “crossing our wake”.</p>

<p>We also added our loop mascot ”Loopy” to the bridge. We won this little gem in a game we played at Christmas. Purchased as a gag gift (cred:Kait+Pat) he was coined Loopy &amp; it was decided he would become our official mascot on the trip (cred:Pam…of course🤣). Since it is the official mascot, we will be sure to feature it in future posts.</p>
