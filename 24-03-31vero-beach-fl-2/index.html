<p>We arrived in Vero after spending a few days in Jensen Beach visiting with my brother Don and his fiancé Kim.</p>

<p>The wind finally died down after blowing for several days and we had a nice calm ride yesterday and were even treated to a pretty long dolphin show; they played in the wake for at least 15 minutes! Today is an absolutely beautiful day. A Goldie Locks day as we like to say...not too hot, not too cold, just right.😉 We got a chance to wash the salt off the boat and take a dinghy ride around the mangroves. It was the first Easter ever that we spent the entire day in bathing suits.👙🩳</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will head back to Cocoa where we will stay a week and stock up for our trip north up the AICW (Atlantic intracoastal waterway).</p>
<p>We are currently 34 miles into the loop. Only about 5,000 to go. 😊</p>
