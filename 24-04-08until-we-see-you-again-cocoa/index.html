<p>So we said our goodbyes last night to dear friends &amp; received quite the send off from a lot of our Cocoa Village Marina community of boat neighbors &amp; staff we’ve gotten to be friends with, some new, some from previous years. I wish we thought to take a pic of the small crowd gathered to wish us well &amp; see us off on this next leg of our adventure!</p>

<p>Two members of said community are a couple we befriended when we saw their boat was our sister ship; same boat different year! Over the past month, we have gotten to know each other better &amp; since their plan is to also embark upon the Great Loop, we decided it would be fun to be buddy boats &amp; venture together. Dennis &amp; Colleen are experienced lake boaters from Kansas City, but the eastern waterways are new to them, so they are thrilled to buddy boat with seasoned East coast cruisers. We began our Loop adventure on our return from the Keys while going through Port St. Lucie, our buddies cruising on Seas the Moment will cross their wake in Cocoa, &amp; they are very excited today is the first day of their Loop adventure!</p>

<p>Last night was bittersweet; while we are excited for our travels, we will miss all the good times we have had with these two! We were treated to a delicious meal consisting of ribs, shoestring fries, corn on the cob, biscuits &amp; homemade ice cream all made by Chef Clark!😋 We marvel at how much fun we always have together &amp; how much we learn from each others life experiences! (Always thankful Pam put us in touch to meet…she was happy for all of us even though I’m sure she suffers greatly with FOMO, wishing she was with us too🤗). Right after dinner, we were lucky to be able to witness our final rocket launch of the season &amp; it was a good one; a Falcon 9 with a booster which means sonic boom upon landing. Very cool, never gets old!🚀🧨</p>
