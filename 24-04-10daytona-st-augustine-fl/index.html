<p>We arrived in Daytona Monday afternoon, which marked our buddy boats successful completion of their official first day on the Loop; congratulations to Dennis &amp; Colleen! We walked around Daytona a bit &amp; stopped at McK’s, a local pub with delicious food. On our walk back to the boat, we were stopped by a couple of Loopers that had recognized our twin boats back at the marina &amp; wanted to meet us. They knocked on our boats &amp; decided we were out for dinner, so stopped us on the street &amp; asked if we were the people on the Mainships 430’s. Turns out he fell in behind us as we were passing through Titusville &amp; followed us all the rest of the way to Daytona. There were also 2 sailboaters that recognized Christopher P from past travels. We chatted with them for quite a bit which was fun &amp; figure we will most likely see them again at some point during our travels.</p>

<p>We left for St. Augustine early Tuesday morning &amp; had a pretty uneventful day just enjoying the beautiful weather. However, as the afternoon progressed, the wind began to kick up. We had booked a mooring for our stay there. Unfortunately the wind was blowing pretty good &amp; there was also a pretty stiff current which can make grabbing a mooring ball quite challenging. After 2 passes, we were able to grab our mooring &amp; get secured. Our buddy boat had never done this before &amp; we realized they had an extra challenge because the float that is supposed to hold the end of the mooring ball line was missing, so the eye part of the line they needed to grab was submerged. So basically they learned with the old ‘trial by fire‘ method…it was pretty rough at that point with wind &amp; current but they both persevered &amp; accomplished the goal! They were also today years old when they learned that boating is basically hours &amp; hours of boredom interrupted by moments of sheer panic!😱</p>

<p>We took the dinghy in to walk around &amp; explore a few back roads in the downtown area. We stopped in The Ancient City brewery for a refreshment. Next stop was at another establishment to meet up with some Gold Loopers that live in St. Augustine; Dennis &amp; Colleen met them at a Looper convention they had attended. It was fun meeting Gene &amp; Big J as we enjoyed cocktails &amp; sharing stories of all of our boating adventures…really nice people! After a while, we decided we needed to head out on our next adventure…dinghying back to our boats in the wind, waves &amp; current. We got a little wet but made it back safe &amp; sound. Tonight we will tie up at Lambs Yachting Center in Jacksonville for a few nights to wait out a blow.</p>
