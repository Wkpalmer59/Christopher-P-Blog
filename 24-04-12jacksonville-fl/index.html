<p>We got an early start from our rocking and rolling mooring in St. Augustine in antcipation of beating the forecasted front coming through. We actually had a pretty uneventful day, arriving in Jacksonville midafternoon.</p>

<p>The slip we were assigned was under newly constructed covered docks. We walked to a nearby local restaurant we had previously discovered on our last stay here in Jax &amp; enjoyed excellent margaritas and Mexican fare.</p>

<p>The next morning the front we were expecting arrived. It was a pretty foul day, but this area was pretty well protected. This however was a bit disconcerting, especially since there was a touchdown 50 miles away the previous day.⬇️</p>

<p>Our original plan was to shove off this morning, however, as we all know, best laid plans…we went for our morning walk, had breakfast &amp; determined it was going to be another pretty windy day, so here we still are. Might have to drown our sorrows in another margarita with a black Hawaiian sea salt rim! Tomorrow we will head up the St. John’s River to Palatka, FL.</p>
