<p>We left Jacksonville on a beautiful Saturday morning and cruised up the St. John’s River to Palatka. Unfortunately we had to leave our buddy boat behind while they wait for a part to fix a generator problem they encountered. We have bypassed this side trip many times, so decided since we were going to have a nice stretch of weather, we should continue on with plan A.</p>
<p>Palatka is a quaint and lovely little town, however, on a Saturday afternoon there was hardly anyone around leaving us to wonder, why so many empty buildings and why does it seem like a ghost town?</p>

<p>It seems as though a lot of work was put into making this a waterfront destination, with nice sidewalks, street signs, parks, memorials &amp; plenty of hotels.</p>
