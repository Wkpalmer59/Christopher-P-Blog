<p>We had a comfortable cruise to Silver Glen Springs after departing Palatka. We had a few interesting sightings along the way…</p>

<p>We found a nice spot just outside of the springs to anchor for the night &amp; took the dinghy in to explore…we regret not taking a photo of the hoards of boats &amp; people who were there on a Sunday, it was reminiscent of a music festival! We decided to head back to our peaceful anchorage &amp; try again on Monday.</p>

<p>Turned out to be an excellent choice; what a difference a day makes! This morning was so much more peaceful with only a few boats passing through &amp; a few just hanging out. We were disappointed that there wasn’t much wildlife to see other than turtles &amp; fish but after seeing yesterday’s party scene, it’s no wonder the wildlife makes itself scarce! As one of Floridas purest &amp; cleanest springs, it’s hard to imagine 65 million gallons of water are being discharged each day but as you can see, it makes for a pretty clear spring.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will work our way back to Palatka where we plan to explore a nature trail we realized we missed.</p>
