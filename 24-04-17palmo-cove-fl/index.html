<p>We had a beautiful cruise in flat calm waters on the way to our intended destination of Palatka, however, as we’ve previously stated about the best laid plans…🙄We were about to tie up at the free dock there and noticed the town looked much busier, most notably a bunch of trailers, and began to put two and two together. During our cruise we noticed a lot of sponsored fishing boats and came to the realization there was a fishing tournament going on. We have been in towns during these tourneys and it is usually a big, loud party scene after the fishing is done, so we decided we preferred the serenity we find on anchor. Captain found a pretty little protected cove about 2 hours away and because the day was so fabulous, we decided to push on.</p>

<p>Pushing on also made for a shorter run today where we will meet back up with our buddy boat in Jacksonville and also take the opportunity to reprovision, wash this filthy boat and fill our water tank after conserving while anchoring these past five days.</p>
