<p>We spent our last night in Florida at a marina we had never stayed before. We couldn’t get into the marina walking distance to downtown which is where we usually stay, so we took an Uber, walked around &amp; enjoyed a few cocktails at Florida’s oldest bar. Today we are headed to Jekyll Island, GA.</p>
