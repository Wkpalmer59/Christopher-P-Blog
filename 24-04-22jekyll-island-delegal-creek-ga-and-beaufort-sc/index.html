<p>We left Amelia Island and headed up to Jekyll Island. The weather was very hot and steamy so soon after we got settled, we reserved a golf cart and carted ourselves around the Island stopping at one of our favorite spots as shown above. It was a long travel day, so we unfortunately did not have much time to do much else. We went downtown &amp; walked around for a little bit.</p>
<p>Our next stop was Delegal Creek where there is nothing other than beautiful homes to admire during our morning walk. It literally is a creek so it was pretty buggy. As we were leaving, we spotted a little black wild pig running around in the marsh. I was too surprised to get to the camera quick enough.😞</p>
<p>After leaving Delegal Creek, we headed to Beaufort, SC. It was one our more unpleasant travel days as we dealt with wind, waves, lightening and rain. We caught a break while docking before the monsoons hit; they were reserved for our walk to the local pub. We had hoped to introduce our friends to a great Mexican restaurant we had been to, but alas, it was Sunday and they closed at 4. We were all pretty soaked upon our arrival to Luther’s. After cocktails and dinner, we arrived back to the boat to relax &amp; hit the sack soon after. It was then that we discovered we had not battened down the hatches and Bill’s side of the bed was soaking wet…he had a less than stellar night of sleep in the forward cabin listening to the flag whipping around in the wind. Needless to say, we are hoping for a quiet uneventful night.😴</p>
