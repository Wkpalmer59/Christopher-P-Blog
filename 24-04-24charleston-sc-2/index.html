<h1>Charleston, SC</h1>

<p>Just south of Charleston, we go through Elliott’s Cut which is one of the narrowest spots on the waterway.</p>

<p>We arrived in Charleston on Monday, our plan was to stay 2 nights. They put us on the mega dock surrounded by mega yachts. It’s a good thing we planned for 2 nights because we had to deal with a battery issue. We knew the batteries were getting old and our plan was to get them replaced when we got back to Milford. As soon as the port battery started getting crabby though, we decided it was time to call the guy and Charleston is a great place to be if any maintenance is needed. Because of this, we didn’t do much of anything else here besides take advantage of a courtesy van ride to Publix. We were glad that at least our boat buddies who haven’t been here before were able to enjoy some of the restaurants and downtown attractions on their own that we have already been to many times. We are impressed with the huge expansion going on at the marina right now which when complete will be one of the biggest, if not the biggest on the east coast.</p>

<p>After leaving Charleston, we went by Fort Sumter at the entrance of Charleston Harbor which was where the first shots of the Civil War were fired.</p>
