<p>We arrived in Chesapeake City yesterday after a relatively short and calm ride up from Havre De Grace. This is a nice little town that was established during the digging of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canals. It is the last good stop before the rather long day through the canal and down the Delaware Bay to Cape May.</p>
<p>We took a short walk through town after arriving to take in some of the history.</p>

<p>They have a good restaurant and Tiki Bar at the marina where we enjoyed a couple cocktails with our boat buddies and then enjoyed “ Docktails“ with some fellow loopers.</p>

<p>It looked like the local high school used the park here for their pre prom photos.</p>
