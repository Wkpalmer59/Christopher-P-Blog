<p>On Wednesday we left Charleston and traveled to Georgetown and along the way we were stopped by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources who were doing routine checks on Documented vessels. Our paperwork was in order so we did not have an issue. However, while one of the officers was on board an idiot in a smaller boat decided it was a good idea to pass between us and the DNR boat at full speed. He found out quickly that it was a very bad idea when he got chased down and ticketed. It was actually quite comical that the one officer went after the speeding boat leaving his partner stranded on our boat. We enjoyed idle chitchat while waiting, but it did make us arrive in port quite a bit later than planned.</p>
<p>Georgetown is one of our favorite stops. It is a great small town with lots of restaurants and shops as well as a maritime museum. On the first night we ate at a place called Between the Antlers which is the latest addition for the town. It had great atmosphere and the food was excellent.</p>

<p>We spent Thursday exploring the town, had lunch at The River Room and toured the maritime museum. Then it was back to the boat for cocktails and nachos. (Capt. Bill’s specialty)</p>

<p>The marina we stayed at had a fresh seafood shop right next door where we purchased some shrimp that was caught the day before.</p>

<p>There was a nice park and beach nearby that was perfect for our morning walks.</p>
<p>Yesterday we traveled to Myrtle Beach where we are currently tied up at the Myrtle Beach Yacht Club. Last night we were able to connect with our friend and former coworker from ADNET Kristy, who kept us up way past our bedtime. 😴</p>
