<p>We stayed on a mooring in Carolina Beach Sunday &amp; Monday night. Other than dealing with a lot of wind, it was a very relaxing stay. We walked into town, checked out the boardwalk, walked the beach many times &amp; stopped at the tiki bar on the pier.</p>

<p>Yesterday we traveled to an anchorage near New River Inlet. Along the way we got stuck behind a dredge with its 4 barges and piping equipment. We stayed behind it as it traversed its way through a bridge which was quite a challenge to say the least! It was very entertaining to watch but it did set us back a good half an hour as they travel painfully slow. At one point, it got very close to one side of the bridge!😳</p>
