<p>On our way to Beaufort, we left our anchorage planning the timing of a bridge opening 4 miles away. As soon as we got through the 8:00 bridge opening, Captain said, “Oh f***k!” as soon as he saw the above sign lights flashing red. We encountered an anchored Naval vessel and were informed we could not travel that part of the waterway for an hour due to live firing exercises. (Navy works with the marines because they don’t have boats; thanks Kara for answering our wondering🤔)! As we sat pondering why they couldn’t time the bridge opening and firing exercises, we were treated to a beautiful rainbow right after a passing shower. Captain has only encountered this once (back in the 80’s) during all the 15 to 20 travel years he’s made this trip!</p>

<p>After an hour passed we weighed anchor and continued on our way. At a certain point, we saw another Naval boat anchored presumably on the other side of firing area, as shortly after passing him, we began to hear booms so loud we could feel the boat vibrate. We thought most likely it was mortar shells they were firing.</p>

<p>We arrived in Beaufort and tied up at a marina that is new to us. We were impressed to see the facility was brand new with many amenities; beautiful clubhouse, courtesy mini van, free ice &amp; free laundry.</p>

<p>We enjoyed perusing the downtown area, stopping in for a cocktail at Moonraker‘s rooftop overlooking the harbor.</p>

<p>We then met up with cousin Kara; happy to see her, sad Steve couldn’t make it. We enjoyed drinks &amp; dinner in a Mexican restaurant &amp; had a leisurely scenic stroll back to the boat with our boat buddies.</p>

<p>We are headed to Oriental, NC where we will spend this afternoon and tomorrow before heading to Belhaven, NC.</p>
