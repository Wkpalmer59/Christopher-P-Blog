<p>This was a new stop for us and we were pleasantly surprised. While it was a small town, the harbor was beautiful and the marina had a lot to offer including a tiki bar and pool.</p>

<p>We walked to a local brewery that had live music and some great beers. The setup was kind of cool. They served beers from the bar through a window to the folks in the outside beer garden who were enjoying the music. It was definitely a local favorite as we noticed most people brought folding chairs &amp; food, then got in line for a beer, sat down and ate while enjoying the music.</p>

<p>We stayed two nights, giving us time to explore the downtown area, hang out and have some down time and also enjoy a nice lunch at the Toucan restaurant located in the marina. We ended the day planning future ventures with boat buddies as we head up into the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>Today we move on to Bellhaven, NC.</p>
