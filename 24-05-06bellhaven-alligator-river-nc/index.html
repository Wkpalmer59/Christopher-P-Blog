<p>We left Oriental yesterday heading for Bellhaven and encountered unexpected weather. It was so hot so we had the bridge all opened up. A few hours in, squalls kept kicking up, making us open, close, open, close, either really hot or getting soaked! The waves were hitting us broadside as we arrived in Bellhaven yesterday with the wind blowing way harder than predicted. The marina in Bellhaven is very exposed to the southwest, which of course was the direction the wind was coming from, so we had to deal with wind and waves while docking. Us along with buddy boat both made it in without any damage, so we will chalk that up as a win.</p>
<p>We celebrated Cinco De Mayo on board &amp; offered to boat sit Seas The Moment (right next door) during wild wind wave weather so Dennis &amp; Colleen could head into town to celebrate at a local Mexican restaurant. We have been in town many times, felt like chilling &amp; of course have the means onboard for a proper celebration. 💃🥃😬</p>
<p>Today we went from the Pungo River to the Alligator River via a 20 mile long manmade canal. Once in the Alligator River we headed for an anchorage just north of the Alligator River bridge to spend the night. We had to deal with a couple of small squalls along the way, which kicked up some wind and waves.</p>

<p>After traversing a slalom course of crab pot buoys in the rain, we are now settled into a fairly well protected anchorage hoping that the weatherman was correct when he said there wouldn’t be any severe thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we head to Coinjock for pretty much the only game in town, prime rib. 😋</p>
