<p>This is one of our fav stops on the waterway. While there isn’t much here, there is a lot of history (both for the waterway and for personal experience). Another plus, the prime rib never disappoints.😋</p>
<p>As is usual, they pack us in here to maximize their dock space.</p>

<p>As we were leaving this morning, the Admiral let out a scream… Captain yelled “You okay”? (to make sure she didn’t fall overboard). She quickly answered OK! Turns out this little guy crawled on her hand as she was clicking the hinge back into place; nature loves her…IYKYK🐀</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he worked his way up into the engine room vent, and we have no idea if he is still aboard. He may find himself suddenly transported from NC to CT. 😀</p>
<p>Today we arrived in Portsmouth, VA where we will spend two days doing some sightseeing</p>
