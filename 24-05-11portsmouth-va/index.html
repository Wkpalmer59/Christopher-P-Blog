<p>We traveled from Coinjock to Portsmouth on Wednesday and tied up at Tidewater Marina. Along the way we passed through the Great Bridge Lock, which normally is not a big deal. However, we entered the lock with a tug and a very large barge and had to squeeze in along side it with only a couple of feet to spare between us. It made for a challenging maneuver, but we got through ok. In hindsight, we wish we got a picture of the challenging situation.</p>
<p>We have always enjoyed this area which has a lot of history.</p>

<p>On Thursday we took the ferry across the Elisabeth River to Norfolk and walked to the Nauticus museum. We opted for the “command and control“ private tour on the Wisconsin battleship which did not disappoint. We toured the bridge, CEC (Combat Engagement Center), and computer targeting systems on the ship. Our tour guide was amazing and had many great stories about the history of the ship. (see below for some more pics and videos)</p>

<p>While in the CEC they played an audio simulation of an actual combat engagement that the Wisconsin experienced during the Iraq war, which was very cool: https://youtube.com/shorts/KkVTrWCA6SM?feature=share</p>
<p>On Friday we made our way to Hampton, VA to set ourselves up for our adventure up into the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
