<h1>Hampton, VA</h1>

<p>On Friday we moved from Portsmouth to Hampton, which was a whole 12 nautical miles, but along the way we passed the naval base in Norfolk.</p>
<figure><img src='rs=w_1280_63196.jpg'></figure>
<p>As we approached the base we heard one of the Navy patrol vessels calling out to the boats passing that they had a 300 yard security zone around a Naval vessel ship that they were escorting in. Turns out it was the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman, which is a Nimitz class carrier. They also called us to make sure we stayed clear. To be clear, Christopher P was directly hailed over the radio to maintain our course.</p>
<p>Turns out the carrier Gerald R. Ford was also in port, which is the first of the new carriers that will replace the Nimitz and Enterprise carrier. (No we didn’t get a picture).😕</p>
<p>We did get a picture of a sub that was in port getting some work done.</p>

<p>Once we got tied up in Hampton at the Bluewater Marina we got a chance to visit with our friend Malcom from our old Stratford Marina days. (Shoutout to Big A.💃 who put us back in touch with Malcolm).</p>
