<p>On Sunday we traveled from Hampton to Deltaville. The first couple of hours were beautiful, but then the wind came up and it got a little sporty. We decided to pick our speed up and burn some fuel to get through the rough weather quicker and more comfortably. We found a somewhat tight area to anchor and decided to raft up with our buddy boat. We took the dinghy into town and walked through the maritime museum grounds. The museum itself was closed, however, they had some nice trails with a lot of memorial sculptures and benches placed along the way.</p>

<p>On the way back we stopped at the only game in town for margaritas to celebrate the moms and enjoy some local oysters.</p>
