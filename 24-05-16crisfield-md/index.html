<p>We are currently tied up in Crisfield, MD, where we planned to spend two nights. However, the weather is not cooperating with heavy rain and wind yesterday, and high winds again today with a small craft warning, so we decided to stay put.</p>
<p>This looks like it would be a great town to visit in mid-summer, but it is early in the season for them here, so just about everything is closed. As you can see from the picture above, crabbing is the big industry here, but unfortunately with everything closed we couldn’t find a restaurant to enjoy them. We did get to do some exploring on our morning walks and took in some of the sights.</p>

<p>There are two islands not far from here (Smith and Tangier) that appear to be big summer destinations as they have many tour boats that will take you out to the islands. Smith Island is evidently famous for the cake that is made there which has been named as the Maryland state dessert. The marina gave us a couple of pieces as part of our arrival package, but we were not impressed.</p>
<p>The weather looks better for tomorrow, so we plan to move on the The Solomons.</p>
