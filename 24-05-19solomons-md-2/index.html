<h1>Solomons, MD</h1>
<p>We arrived in the Solomons on Friday after a relatively uneventful ride from Crisfield. We got in around noon and had lunch at a local restaurant where both of the Admiral’s had “the best crab cake ever”. We then walked around the town and checked out the local Tiki Bar as a potential stop later.</p>

<p>We went back to the boat for a brief stop and then back out to the Tiki Bar looking for some live music so our boat buddies could satisfy their dancing itch. Unfortunately the band was not all that great, so we headed back to the boat after a couple of songs and the ladies got a chance to get some beads from the band.</p>
