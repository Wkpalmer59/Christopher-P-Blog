<p>We arrived in St. Michaels on Saturday and were immediately sorry that we did not book two days there. It is a great little town with quaint little streets and homes, several restaurants, tons of shops, a brewery, winery and rum distillery. There is also a maritime museum.</p>

<p>Of course our first stop was the distillery and brewery where we sampled and purchased some of their wares.</p>

<p>We had dinner at a local saloon that was recommended by the woman in the distillery and it turned out to be just our kind of place.</p>

<p>In the morning we had some time to walk through the museum grounds where we spotted this interesting figurehead.</p>

<p>After breakfast we strolled through the town &amp; did a little shopping before our departure since we had a short trip to our next destination, Rock Hall MD.</p>
