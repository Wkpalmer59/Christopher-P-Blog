<p>We arrived in Rock Hall on Sunday and after an enjoyable afternoon, we decided that this is another one of our favorite stops on the Chesapeake. We’ve been here before, but this time we got a recommendation for a restaurant (from locals that were in St. Michaels). We checked it out online on our way there; while the reviews were excellent we also found out that it was only open until 5:30 on Sunday. After arriving &amp; getting tied up &amp; settled, we quickly headed up to the marina office and grabbed the courtesy bikes to ride to the Blue Heron Restaurant (which turned out to be an adventure in itself after margaritas &amp; beers🤪).</p>
<p>Here are a couple videos of our ride:</p>

<p>We got back to the boat after cocktails and dinner without any major injuries, although Colleen did take a minor spill upon arriving back at the dock office as she was waving to the staff proclaiming “We made it”!</p>
<p>We enjoyed a peaceful evening on the boat enjoying the sunset.</p>

<p>On our morning walk we went through the local park and visited the oysterman memorial.</p>

<p>On Monday we walked into town and visited a local farmers market and then a small grocery for supplies. We settled in for a quiet night on the boat.</p>
<p>Today we moved on to Havre De Grace.</p>
