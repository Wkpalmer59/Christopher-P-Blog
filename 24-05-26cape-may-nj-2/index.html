<p>We arrived in Cape May on Friday after a very calm trip down the Delaware Bay, probably the best trip we have ever had on the Bay. Yesterday we showed our boat buddies the sights and enjoyed lunch in town before hitting the grocery for some supplies.</p>

<p>The weather has been beautiful, but we woke up to fog on Saturday which didn’t burn off until after lunch.</p>

<p>Today we did an off shore run up to Atlantic City and had to deal with quite a bit of fog; more to follow on that situation in tomorrows blog.🌁🌫️</p>
