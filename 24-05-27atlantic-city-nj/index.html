<p>We had a very foggy ride up from Cape May yesterday. While our radar and chart plotter work great it is still unsettling to not be able to see where you are going or the other boat around you that you know are there but cannot see.</p>

<p>Once we arrived in AC, we anchored in a protected spot that we found last year and settled in for the night. The fog cleared for the most part and we enjoyed a nice evening alongside the locals partying.</p>

<p>We decided to stay here another day due to the lousy forecast for today and it turned out to be a good call. We have had several thunderstorms and the wind has been blowing. Our anchor has been holding well.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we plan to head up the Jersey Intracoastal Water to Manasquan where we will wait for our opportunity to run off shore into New York Harbor and on to Long Island Sound.</p>
