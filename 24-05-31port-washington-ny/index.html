<p>On Wednesday we made the trip offshore from NJ through NY Harbor into Long Island Sound and were treated to calm seas and a current push pretty much the whole way; we hit 12 knots in the East River (we normally do 8).</p>

<p>We stayed on a mooring Wednesday night and had some pretty strong thunderstorms move through, which got a little sporty to say the least. On Thursday we moved to a marina to charge things up and fill the water tanks. We then walked to a local Mexican restaurant, sat outside and enjoyed a pitcher (or two😬) of excellent margaritas made for us by the manager.</p>

<p>Back on the boat we were treated to a gorgeous sunset, and of course we took a bunch of pics that were so hard to choose from.</p>

<p>Today we got fuel in Black Rock Harbor for $3.24 per gallon compared to $4.81 in Port Washington! We then headed over to Port Jeff where we picked up our friends mooring for the weekend. (Thanks Alan &amp; Betty!)</p>
