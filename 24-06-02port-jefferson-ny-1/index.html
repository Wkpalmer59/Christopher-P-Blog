<p>Since we couldn’t go into Milford Harbor until Monday we decided to spend the weekend in Port Jeff. Betty and Alan let us use their mooring so we were able raft up and enjoy a peaceful weekend. The weather couldn’t have been any more beautiful.</p>
<p>Here is a video of a helicopter landing at one of the nearby homes as the sun set.</p>

<p>We were able to take the dinghy over to the beach for our morning walks.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning we will make the short trip across the sound to Milford so we can see our daughters, visit with friends &amp; other family and prep the boat for the next leg of our journey. We have now traveled 1,610 nautical miles since we started the loop in Port St. Lucie. Only about 4,400 to go.⚓️</p>
