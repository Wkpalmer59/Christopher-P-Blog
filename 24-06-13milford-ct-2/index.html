<p>We have spent the last week and a half in a whirlwind trying to get a bunch of projects done, get our annual doctor and dental appointments done, visit as many family and friends as we could and provision for the next leg of our journey. We have been mostly successful and have decided to add an extra day in town to finish up some odds and ends.</p>
<p>We had a much anticipated get together with many of our good friends and family the day after we arrived and as usual, ate, drank and had too much fun!☺️🍕🥗🍻</p>

<p>We also had the opportunity to finally catch up with friends Betty and Alan, which was great!</p>

<p>The Admiral took a trip on the train to Westport with the girls to go wedding dress shopping for Kait.</p>

<p>We got the boat hauled to power wash the bottom, change out the sacrificial anodes, and touch up the bottom paint. Everything checked out good.👍</p>

<p>Here are a couple of videos of the boat going back in the water.</p>

<p>We even got our canvas work finished up, which we thought might hold us up.</p>
<p>We plan to leave on Saturday to head up the Hudson River for the next leg of The Great Loop.</p>
