<p>We left Port Washington on Sunday (which we apparently forgot to publish that blog🙄) and traversed the East River to Hell Gate and then headed up the Harlem River. We went under a bunch of bridges and saw many interesting sights.</p>

<p>We concerned about the last bridge just before entering the Hudson as there was not a lot of available information about its schedule and we knew it was too low for us to go under, but luckily it was open when we got to it.</p>
<p>Entering the lower Hudson was very cool as its size is impressive and the mountainous view are pretty spectacular!</p>

<p>We didn’t get to go under the GW bridge, but we did see it behind us as we turned up the Hudson.</p>
<p>We arrived arrived at Half Moon Bay Marina around midafternoon, and settled in for a two night stay. The reviews for this place were great but we were not impressed with overall condition of the marina. The people were very nice and the beautiful views made up for it though!</p>

<p>Today we are headed up to Poughkeepsie, NY.</p>
