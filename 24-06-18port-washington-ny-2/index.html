<p>We did a quick overnight in Port Washington after leaving Milford. Pam came down to see us off and catch a picture of us leaving the dock and then leaving the harbor. Thanks girl!😍</p>

<p>We had a crazy two weeks in Milford, but we did get to have another nice visit with the girls and Pat before we shoved off.</p>

<p>This morning we were able to catch up with the previous owner of our boat who was out fishing with his two sons on Father’s Day. The previous name of the boat was MILAN II after his two sons.</p>
<p>Today we are headed up the Harlem River and then on the Hudson up to Half Moon Bay.</p>
