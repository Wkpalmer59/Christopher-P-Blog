<p>We had a short run yesterday from Poughkeepsie to Kingston, again enjoying the scenery along the way.</p>

<p>Kingston is a quaint little town with some good restaurants and cute shops.</p>

<p>We visited the local Maritime Museum (mostly because it was air conditioned).😬 They did however some great exhibits of the steamboats that sailed on the Hudson, along with an ice boat exhibit which we found fascinating and have decided that we have a new bucket list item...to go for a sail on an ice boat! One boat held the speed record of 145 mph! It was apparently at one time quite a popular sport on the Hudson.</p>
<p>On our walk this morning we passed a cafe that had some creative advertising outside.⬇️</p>
