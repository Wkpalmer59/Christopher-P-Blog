<p>We arrived here Friday after another scenic ride up the Hudson. The light houses along the river are as nice as the ones we are used to seeing in New England.</p>

<p>We also got. Chance to connect with Jeff and Darlene who we last saw down in Florida when they were traveling in their RV. (Yes, we forgot to get a selfie with them 🙄).</p>
<p>Today we are headed up to Troy which will be our last stop before heading into the Erie Canal and doing our first “Flight“ of locks.</p>
