<p>We had a very nice ride up the Hudson from Half Moon Bay to Poughkeepsie on Tuesday enjoying the scenery along the way. We passed Bear Mountain, West Point, Bannerman Castle, and the deepest part of the Hudson called “Worlds End”, where depths reach 200’.</p>

<p>Yesterday we took an Uber to the FDR museum and library, which was well worth the trip. We even got a tour of his house.</p>

<p>We learned so much, including the fact that FDR was the only president that served more than 2 terms and was actually elected to a fourth term, but died a few months in. He and Eleanor are buried in the rose garden on the property.</p>
<p>In Poughkeepsie they have an old railroad bridge that has been converted into a walk way over the Hudson with an elevator that takes you to the top. We attempted to go there on our walk on Tuesday morning but found out it does not open until 8am and not previously knowing this, we arrived too early (7:30) since it has been so hot. This morning we tried again and arrived at 8am, but no one showed up to open the gates, so after a 15 minute wait we gave up. Just too hot!🥵</p>
