<h1>Troy, NY</h1>

<p>We had a short run up to Troy on Sunday with a pretty stiff wind and a following sea, but it was uneventful. We again enjoyed some great scenery and the skyline as we passed through Albany.</p>

<p>After tying up we got the opportunity to reconnect with some former coworkers. Early afternoon we enjoyed a visit with Nick and his pretty cool kids, Caroline and Jackson, who had some fun exploring the boat. We had a bit of ugly weather as well which passed through pretty quickly.⛈️ During our visit, Nick imparted an interesting historical fact that the original Uncle Sam (Samuel Wilson) was a Troy native and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery here.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, another former coworker, Lindsay came down with her boyfriend Henry for happy hour on the boat. While chatting, we came to realize that Henry, as an athlete, went to school in Bridgeport, CT with someone who is marrying the daughter of very good friends of ours, Ryan &amp; Robin...small world!  ❤️Alex&amp;Casey❤️</p>

<p>On our walk this morning we got to do some more exploring of the neat town here and decided to stay for another night.</p>

<p>For the next part of our adventure, we will be heading to Schenectady, NY where we will be doing our first flight of locks, (7 to be exact) which should prove to be quite interesting.😉</p>
