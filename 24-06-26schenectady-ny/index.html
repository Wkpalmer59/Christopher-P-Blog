<p>Yesterday we left Troy early and went through 7 locks in about 18 miles to get to Schenectady. In total we were raised up 211 feet! The first lock was still on the Hudson and is a federal lock. It raised us the first 15 feet.</p>

<p>Here is video that starts once we were in the chamber. https://youtu.be/qzF1q1zVvSo</p>
<p>We then traveled a little ways up the Hudson and then took a left into the Erie Canal where we traversed the Waterford “flight” of locks. The locks on the canal are run by the state of New York.</p>

<p>Here is a video of us entering the first of the Erie Canal locks and raising up about 33 feet. https://youtu.be/nnsKX-JjNME</p>
<p>We increased the speed of the videos as each lock takes about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Schenectady Yacht Club around 1pm could immediately see that the members here must have a lot of fun on weekends and holidays. They have a great pool here too; we threw on suits, packed a cooler and enjoyed cocktails, swimming &amp; sunning. We also had fun looking around the grounds at all the different picnic areas setups. Yacht club members set up and customize their own party area complete with rugs, furniture, fire pits, grills and even full size refrigerator/freezer!</p>
<p>This is just a sample.</p>

<p>We were impressed by the amount of land owned by this club. The grounds are pretty big!</p>
<p>Today we took an Uber to the local Walmart Super Center to re-provision before we head further into the Erie where we expect to have to spend a few nights on free walls where we may not have power. Tomorrow we are shooting for Amsterdam NY.</p>
<p>We have currently traveled 1,813 nautical miles since we started the loop in Port St Lucie FL</p>
