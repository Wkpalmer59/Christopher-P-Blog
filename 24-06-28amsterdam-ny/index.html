<p>We had a challenging day yesterday with the wind gusting 25-30 mph. It was hard to hold the boat in place while the lock filled up. We only had 3 locks to do and we did it without any major issues.</p>
<p>Amsterdam is a nice town with a nice park and walking bridge. We stayed on our first wall, which fortunately had power, (at least for the first 4 boats).😬</p>

<p>We had to deal with some wakes from the water ski club that practices and does their shows right by the wall, but it was fun watching a classic water ski show.</p>

<p>Here is a video of a trick we hadn’t seen before. The skiers going around the boat.</p>

<p>I did catch another good lock video that shows the complete process, with us entering and exiting the lock and as an added treat, a photo bomb by the Admiral.😉</p>

<p>Today we are headed to Johnsville, NY and will do another 5 locks.</p>
