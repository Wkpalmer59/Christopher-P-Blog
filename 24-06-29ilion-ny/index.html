<p>Today was a rainy crappy day and many of the looper boats we have seen along the way seemed to be staying put. We decided to move on and other than the pretty constant rain, the weather wasn’t too bad. We had originally planned to go to Frankfort where there is a free dock next to a brewery, but as we were passing this marina, we could see they had spaces available. Since we were a bit concerned about docking availability in Frankfort with so many staying put, we decided on the old “bird in the hand” logic and just stopped here. Not much to do here but hunker down and wait out the rain.</p>
<p>On the way here we went through an unusual lock that has a guillotine gate and a concrete wall that you pass under. It then raised us up 40 feet!</p>

<p>So far we have been raised up 382 feet since our first lock in Troy!</p>
<p>We have also passed under several “guard gates“ that are in place in case a lock fails and they have to hold back the water. It‘s a bit disconcerting to think about what would happen if one let loose while passing under it. 😳</p>

<p>Tomorrow we are going to get an early start so we can try to get a good spot at the free pier at Sylvan Beach, NY which appears to be a popular spot.</p>
