<p>We just did a quick overnight at the municipal marina in St. Johnsville, which is just a wall, not much exciting to report. However, we had good power and terrific water pressure so we took the opportunity to clean up the boat some. The water is also supposed be the best tasting water around so we also topped off the water tanks. We walked into the small town and found a local bar with a pool table. Turns out Dennis used to play in a competitive league (we found out soon after the game began) and he was able to beat the captain easily.</p>
<p>We did found find this sign board that had a great overview of the Erie Canal.</p>

<p>Today we are headed for a free dock in Frankfort, NY that is supposedly near a brewery.😬🍻</p>
