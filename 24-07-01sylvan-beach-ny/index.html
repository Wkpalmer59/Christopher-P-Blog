<h1>Sylvan Beach, NY</h1>

<p>We left Ilion early and in the rain yesterday so we could be one of the first boats through the next lock. We locked through with there other boats on the first opening at 8am. We then traversed the all man made section of the Erie dodging a lot of logs and other debris left over from the rain.</p>

<p>We did hit something twice, but never saw what it was. We don’t think we have any prop damage, which we will confirm that as we cross Lake Oneida today and have a chance to run full speed.</p>
<p>We arrived in Sylvan beach around 1pm and got the last two spots on the free wall here.🥵 Most of the boat neighbors gathered to help our boats in and introduce themselves. Many of them we have been playing leapfrog with on our travels, including an all orange tug type boat called Manatee whose owners have done the loop 34 times!</p>

<p>This is clearly a summer hang out for the locals with a beach on the lake, many restaurants and a good old fashion amusement park. We wandered around a bit, stopped at a place on the beach called Harpoon Eddies for a cocktail and listened to the band playing which was really good. We stopped a few times at the nearby local park to listen to whichever blues band was up.</p>

<p>There was even a blues fest on the field near the beach.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing hard off the lake and looking out, we were glad that we were not traveling across it today.</p>

<p>Today we are headed across the lake which seems to have calmed down and stop on the other side at Brewerton, NY where we will take on fuel for the first time since leaving Long Island Sound.</p>
