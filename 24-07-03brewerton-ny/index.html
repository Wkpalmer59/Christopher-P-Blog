<h1>Brewerton, NY</h1>

<p>On Monday we did a short run across Lake Oneida and it was much calmer than the day before.</p>

<p>We did a quick overnight in Brewerton where we picked up a hitchhiker.</p>

<p>Yesterday we had a long day as we did the last lock on the Erie Canal for us and then went north on the Oswego Canal where we did another 7 locks.</p>

<p>Early in the day the wheel on the bridge was feeling a little choppy and then a short time later a screw fell out and it pretty much jammed up all together. Between using the lower station (first time we have ever piloted the boat from the lower station) and the auto pilot on the bridge, we were able to keep going while we did repairs on the fly, (which truly felt like being on a pit crew trying to get as much accomplished in between locks)! Good thing Don was on board so the captain could focus on doing the repairs in between locks. We had to take apart the whole steering column to reconnect the coupler in the tilt mechanism. Fortunately nothing was actually broken, the screws just loosened up and the coupler came apart.</p>

<p>We went through our 30th lock as we came out of the Oswego Canal into Lake Ontario.</p>

<p>At the last lock in the Erie Canal that raised us, we reached an elevation of 420’. We then went down about 130’ to reach the level of Lake Ontario.</p>
<p>Once we reached the lake, we took advantage of the good weather and did another 35 nautical miles to Sacket Harbor, NY where we will spend the 4th of July holiday, after which we will head to Clayton, NY.</p>
