<h1>Sackets Harbor, NY</h1>

<p>We arrived at Sacket Harbor on Tuesday, which was a day earlier than we originally planned and were happy we did as it blew pretty good on Wednesday. We were also happy to find a home for the July 4th at the last minute.</p>
<p>This is a great little town with a lot of history centered around the war of 1812 and a big battle that was fought here. There is a huge battle field with trails and many signs depicting the battle and the aftermath.</p>

<p>We were able to also enjoy some fireworks that they shot from the nearby battlefield.</p>

<p>We had originally planned to leave here today and move on the Clayton NY and then on to Kingston, ON in Canada where we will need to clear customs. Unfortunately we could not get dock in Clayton and could not get into Kingston until Sunday, so we decided to spend another night in Sackets rather than spend two nights on the hook in Clayton, especially since it is supposed to be humid and rainy tonight, which would mean having the boat closed up with no AC. 🥵</p>
