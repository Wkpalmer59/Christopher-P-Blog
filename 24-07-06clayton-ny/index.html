<p>Today we had an absolutely beautiful ride from Sackets Harbor into the St. Lawrence River and on to Clayton, NY.</p>

<p>We anchored in the harbor and took the dinghy into town. One of our first sightings was an antique wooden boat museum; we hemmed and hawed about doing a tour and  finally decided to and were glad we did. It was awesome! We won’t bore you with a bunch of pics, but here are some highlights.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will do a tour through the Thousand Islands and then head to Kingston Ontario. We found out on one the forums we follow that the liquor control board employees in Ontario are on strike and we will not be able to buy liquor once we cross over into Ontario. We are also limited by the amount of liquor that we are allowed to bring into Canada. Oh no! 😳</p>
<p>After leaving the museum we did find a liquor store……..🤫</p>
<p>We stopped at the Wooden Boat Brewery before heading back to the boat.</p>

<p>Fortunately we have a nice breeze to keep us cool on the hook tonight.</p>
