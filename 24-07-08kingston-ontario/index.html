<p>We started the day yesterday by pulling anchor in Clayton and being amazed at the amount of grass that was tangled up in the anchor chain and anchor itself. Fortunately our guest crew member did the bulk of the work removing it as we slowly pulled the anchor up and cleared it.</p>

<p>We have been amazed by how clear the water is here and how much vegetation is growing up from the bottom.</p>

<p>After we cleared the anchor, we took a leisurely trip through the 1000 Islands and, yes Thousand  Island dressing does come from here, although there is some controversy as to who actually created it.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures, although they do not do it justice.</p>

<p>We even saw our first cable ferry. You cannot pass in front of the ferry because you will get tangled up in the cable.</p>

<p>The water depths are amazing, you can be right next to an island and be in over a hundred feet of water!</p>

<p>As we passed into Canadian waters we raised our Canadian courtesy flag (according to flag etiquette it should be flown from the starboard spreader) and our quarantine flag which signifies that we have not passed customs yet. Once we docked in Kingston, we called the Canadian Border Services Agency who asked for our passport info and if we had anything to declare, then they gave us a reporting number and said have a nice day. Couldn’t have been easier. I guess some folks have been boarded, but we were lucky I guess.</p>
<p>Kingston is a beautiful city with some great architecture that has been very well maintained. There was a street festival going on when we got here and we were able to enjoy some street performers.</p>
