<h1>Trenton, ON &amp; Trent-Severn Waterway Day 1</h1>

<p>On Tuesday we had planned to go to Picton Ontario and anchor, but with the remnants of Beryl headed our way, we decided to push on to Trenton where we could tie up at a marina and wait it out. The marina was very nice with new facilities but there wasn’t much to do, so we just hunkered down and got a couple of inside projects done while we waited out the all day rain on Wednesday.</p>

<p>One of the perks of the Great Loop association we joined is that there are “Harbor Hosts” at a lot of the places we visit. The hosts in Trenton took pictures of us as we came in and also as we departed (feature photo at the top). They sent us an email with the pictures and a whole bunch of information on the services in the town and what to expect as we head into the waterway. Very helpful!</p>

<p>Today we headed into the Trent-Severn waterway and did our first 6 locks, which are very different than what we experienced on the Erie. They are much smaller and more narrow, with only two boats going through at once.</p>

<p>The people staffing the locks couldn’t be any nicer, with some of them being college students doing summer jobs. They help you get tied up and shoved off and also contact the next lock to let them know you are coming. They even helped us figure out which locks had room on their walls for us to tie up for night.</p>
<p>Construction of the waterway started in the 1800’s but wasn’t completed until 1920, so parts of it are very old with many of the lock gates operating manually. The workers definitely get their steps in during a day with a lot of boats locking through.</p>

<p>We are spending the night on the wall at the bottom of Lock 7 in Glen Ross. Tomorrow we will move on to Old Mill Park and do another 5 locks.</p>
<p>So far we have raised 119 feet. We will do a total of 43 locks in the Trent-Severn with one of them raising us 65’!</p>
