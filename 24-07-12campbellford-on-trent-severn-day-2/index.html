<h1>Campbellford, ON - Trent-Severn Day 2</h1>

<p>We spent last night at the bottom of lock 7 in Glen Ross at the lock wall, which was very peaceful.</p>

<p>As we settled in last night we heard some splashing and a lot of honking and noticed a family of Canada geese were trying to make their way from the top of the lock down to the lower waterway. The parents went first and they honked like crazy trying to convince the youngsters to jump...so funny watching them look at the jump from the edge and go back to the level they are at. Since they do have the ability to fly, we wondered why they basically do a bridge jump and plop into the water. In the end, four out of five littles made the leap; one got left behind for the night😢. We did find out the next day from the lock master that mom and dad came back for the straggler in the morning.</p>

<p>We left Glen Ross this morning on the second lock through around 9:45 am (we let two boats go ahead of us so we could stay together with our buddy boat) and did another 20 miles and 6 locks to get to Campbellford. We were raised another 118 feet with the next “flight“ of 2 locks raising us 48 feet. In Canada, a flight of locks is two locks together where you go from one chamber to another. It was very cool.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Campbellfor, we found out they are having a big festival this weekend and are a little sad we did not book 2 nights since it is right next to where we are tied up.</p>
