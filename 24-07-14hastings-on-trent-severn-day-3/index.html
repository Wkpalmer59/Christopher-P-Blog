<h1>Hastings, ON Trent-Severn Day 3</h1>

<p>Yesterday we only traveled about 13 miles, but we did 6 more locks, with one of them being a flight of 2 locks that raised us 54 feet. I was able to get a good video of the experience. I cut out some parts and sped it up to get it to 2.5 minutes, but it really took us about 25 minutes.</p>

<p>I also took this picture from the top of the lock, but again it doesn’t do it justice.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful Saturday, so we passed many lake houses where folks were enjoying the day.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of boat and jet ski traffic.</p>

<p>Hastings is a small town centered around lock 18 and the associated park. We were going to stay on the wall there but were told a tour boat was coming through that would take up the whole wall so we tied up at a marina instead, which allowed us to run the AC. 😊 Turns out the tour boat never even arrived.</p>
<p>As with most of the locks, lock 18 has an associated dam. With all the rain from the remnants of Beryl, the currents have been strong with the dams dumping a lot of water.</p>

<p>Today we are going about 37 miles to Peterborough and only have one lock. On todays journey, we will also be passing through Rice Lake which is the 2nd largest lake in the Trent-Severn.</p>
