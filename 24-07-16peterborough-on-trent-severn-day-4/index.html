<h1>Peterborough, ON - Trent-Severn Day 4</h1>

<p>We traveled about 35 miles on Sunday and only did one lock, but it was one of the first locks built on the waterway and is the only limestone lock left.</p>

<p>We also had to dodge some restless natives along the way, with one of them asking if he could jump on our boat.🤣</p>

<p>We spent 2 nights here and did some re-provisioning. Don left us today, flying out of Toronto back to Boston. He will surely be missed as we get back to being a 2 man crew!</p>

<p>This is a great town with a large main street with many shops, although since it was Monday, there wasn’t much open.</p>
<p>Today we are only doing about 15 miles, but will go through 8 locks, including the Peterborough Lift Lock. I hope to get some good video with the GoPro. Our destination today is Young’s Point where we hope to find a spot on a wall there to spend the night. The weather is looking dicey with scattered t-storms around, but we decided to push on keeping eyes on the radar &amp; tying up to a wall if we need to wait any storms out.</p>
