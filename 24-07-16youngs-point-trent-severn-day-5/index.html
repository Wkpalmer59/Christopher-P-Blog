<h1>Young’s Point, ON - Trent Severn Day 5</h1>

<p>The forecast this morning called for the possibility of some severe thunderstorms, so we considered staying put another day in Peterborough, but decided to push on. We made it to the base of the lift lock just north of Peterborough, and proceeded to enter the lock, but after getting all tied up, we were told that there was a lightning strike nearby and we had to stay put in the lock for 30 minutes. Policy is that for any nearby strike, it’s a 30 minute wait time and for any subsequent strikes, it’s a 30 minute reset. This made for a pretty long day! Within 30 minutes, that particular storm cell passed and the lift commenced. This is one of the highlights of the Trent-Severn that were were looking forward to, and it didn’t disappoint.</p>
<p>Here is a video of our perspective. Note the admiral working hard to secure the boat. We are missing our third crew member at this point.    (Don made it more leisurely for us for sure!)</p>

<p>Here is a video that one of our fellow loopers took from the base of the lock as we and our buddy boat were lifted.</p>

<p>Here is a picture looking back from the top of the lock, 65’ up from where we started.</p>

<p>Once we got to the top of the lock we attempted to move on, but we came across a swing bridge that we needed to open, but they had shut down due to another lightning strike. We decided to turn around and tie up to the wall above the lift lock and wait it out. It took a while, but we had a leisurely lunch while we waited.</p>

<p>We got going again about 1:30 and continued on to the base of lock 27, our 7th lock of the day, arriving about 5pm. We secured a spot on a wall below our next lock with no power tonight but hopefully things will soon be cooling down. We have been lifted a total of 519 feet since we started the Trent-Severn. Tomorrow we will move on to Bobcaygeon.</p>
