<p>After leaving Young’s Point yesterday we passed through lock 27 and out into Clear Lake and then lock 28 put us into Buckhorn Lake. We were blown away at how beautiful it is up here. The water is clear and there are so many small islands and narrow passages. We had to pay close attention to the charts, as there are a lot of rocks around, but it is well marked.</p>

<p>One of the lock masters told us about a small church on an island where the locals get married. Evidently you have to be a resident here to get married there.</p>

<p>We have also seen a bunch of rental houseboats of all sizes and we have been warned to to be mindful around them as they do not need a license or any prior boating experience to rent one and are only shown a 15 minute introduction video before sending them on their way.</p>

<p>Today we are in a great little town called Bobcageon, pronounced bob-cajun. We enjoyed walking around and even did a little shopping. We were told this is a big shopping destination and people come from all over to shop at Bigley, the everything store. It was pretty  ”bigley” for sure! Tomorrow we will move on through the Kawartha Lakes to Bolsover.</p>
