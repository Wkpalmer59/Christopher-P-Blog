<p>This is a combined post as we have not had good internet access until today.</p>
<p>On Friday we traveled from Bobcaygeon to Bolsover. We did our last “up” lock reaching a total height of 595 feet. The first down lock was a regular lock and then we did the Kirkfield lift lock which lowered us 49 feet. Pretty cool hanging out over the edge.</p>

<p>We then traveled through the narrowest sections we have ever done. They recommend that you put out a “security“ call on the radio to let other boaters know you are coming through so 2 big boats don’t end up bow to bow with no way for both to fit through, but apparently not everyone listens as we met 5 other boats coming the other way and didn’t have fun trying to pass them.</p>

<p>We did see some other interesting sights along the way.</p>

<p>Yesterday we did another 5 down locks in quick succession, then crossed lake Simcoe, which is the largest body of water on the Trent-Severn. We arrived in Orillia and tied up in a large municipal marina with great facilities, but were surprised to see that it was pretty empty. There are a bunch of loopers here and we joined an impromptu Docktails party and met a bunch of other loopers.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we are moving on and will plan to get in line for the main event on the Trent-Severn, the ”Big Chute” marine railway.</p>
