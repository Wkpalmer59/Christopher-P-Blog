<h1>Big Chute, ON - Trent-Severn Day 9</h1>

<p>This morning we left Orillia and headed toward the big chute. We got held up at a railroad bridge that gave us information via signage as we arrived and offered no other means of communication.</p>

<p>We found out that the “next turn” means the next opening. We arrived at 9:30 with no train in sight and had to wait until 11:00 to get through. Two trains passed with a total of about 300 cars. The crazy part is that we jockeyed around in a small area with about 5 boats behind us doing the same for 1.5 hours and there was plenty of time between trains for us to be able to pass through…apparently it’s a crap shoot.  Once the bridge finally opened, we realized why they don‘t open on demand. This bridge is so old and crochety…the noises as it fired up were quite frightening!🫣</p>
<p>Once we finally got through, we again passed through some absolutely beautiful waterways with tight passages. We now understand why folks would want to have summer houses up here.</p>

<p>We have seen a bunch of sea planes and today we got to see one take off.</p>
<p>(Who remembers “zee plane!”)?</p>

<p>We went through one of the newest locks on the Trent-Severn with a 47’ drop in a regular lock, which was impressive.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Big Chute with the plan to tie up for the night and check it out before we had to go through ourselves. We found a good spot to tie up and were able to watch some other boats go through this amazing engineering feat.</p>

<p>Here is a video of the cables used to make this happen.</p>

<p>We also got a view of the first railway built in 1917 that was replaced by the current railway in 1978.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning we will be in line to experience the Big Chute ourselves. We will try to capture good video and pictures. After that, we head out into the Georgian Bay which promises to be absolutely beautiful.</p>
