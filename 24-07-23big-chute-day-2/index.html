<h1>Big Chute - Day 2</h1>

<p>We got up this morning and went for our walk and ran into one of the lock masters who informed us that they were having a problem with one of the damn gates that was allowing way more water down the chute than usual which creates a dangerous current in front of the railway car entrance so they had to shut it down for safety. They opened it back up around 2pm today, but with all the boats ahead of us and the amount of time it takes for each boat to get on and off loaded with same thing on the other side, we figured out we won’t be able to get through until tomorrow. Our goal is to be on the ”blue line” this evening, so we are staged for tomorrow morning. We are not allowed on the blue wall until the lock is closed so we will start scoping a spot soon before their closure.</p>
<p>Here is a video of what the rushing water looked like this morning.</p>

<p>We took the opportunity to walk around a bit more and gather some more info on how the Big Chute operates.</p>

<p>Assuming we get through tomorrow, we will be headed to Midland, which will be our first port in the Georgian Bay.</p>
