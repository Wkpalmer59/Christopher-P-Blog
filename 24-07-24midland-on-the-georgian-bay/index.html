<p>After the hold up at the Big Chute yesterday we moved from the free dock to the blue line dock at 5:30pm so we were positioned for passage in the morning. As we touched on previously, every lock has a designated wall or dock that is painted blue, and when you tie up there you are signaling that you are ready to go through on the next available lock.</p>
<p>While on the free dock yesterday, one of our fellow loopers took a great drone shot of us sitting at the dock.</p>

<p>At 9am this morning we were ready to go, but were then informed that we could not proceed because of thunder and lightning (again🙄). About 10am they signaled they were ready for us.</p>
<p>We had the GoPro ready to go and caught the whole experience. We did not speed this one up because we feel as though this one is worth watching the whole 12 minutes with sound. When you have the time, we think you will as well.</p>

<p>After the Big Chute we traversed the last of the Trent-Severn waterway and went through the final lock. That makes 74 locks between the Erie and Trent-Severn. We are done with locks until we get through Chicago and head down the inland rivers. (We are both OK with that.)😊</p>
<p>However, we were not done with challenging navigation as we traversed some extremely narrow channels. It was so tight, Captain could not even afford to let the stern swing out of a skinny area.</p>

<p>We are here for two nights as it is supposed to blow tomorrow. On Friday we head into the Georgian Bay, and from what we have heard from many folks, it should be amazing.</p>
