<h1>Midland, ON - Day 2</h1>

<p>We stayed 2 days in Midland to avoid the wind on Thursday since we needed to cross the Georgian Bay. We did a bit more exploring and got a few more pictures. This September, Midland will celebrate their art by having their first mural festival. This is a great spot with a nice marina, although we did have some technical difficulties with their shore power which was ultimately solved by a boater with local knowledge. The harbormaster then showed up to help our buddy boat get power which entailed a move to the only other spot in the marina with 50 amp power. Normally no power isn’t a big deal but we had already spent 2 nights with no power and coincidentally, the next morning our generator wouldn’t start. Captain figured out the problem, had the spare parts and fixed it pretty quickly the next morning.</p>

<p>Our boat buddy shared a picture they took of our boat in the Big Chute carriage that is pretty cool.</p>
