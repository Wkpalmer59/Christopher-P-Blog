<p>We had a beautiful ride yesterday along the “small boat“ channel in the Thirty Thousand Islands in the Georgian Bay. The Canadian Coast Guard considers anything under 70’ to be a small boat, so I’d say we qualify.😉</p>
<p>There are still some very narrow channels and with a good amount of boat traffic on a Friday it was challenging in some spots. The water is crystal clear and you can see bottom in over 15’ of water. Some folks liken it to the Bahamas, but we are not seeing that. It is more like what we saw in Maine.</p>

<p>Henry’s “World Famous” restaurant sits on Frying Pan Island and the only way you can get here is by boat, or sea plane. Which we witnessed.</p>

<p>When we docked they had us pull all the way up to the shore on the dock and we still had 26’ of water under the boat.</p>

<p>Despite being somewhat isolated the restaurant does a brisk business with many small boats coming and going.</p>
<p>Today we will continue up the channel to an anchorage in Snug Harbor. We plan to get an early start in hopes of avoiding some of the Saturday boat traffic.</p>
