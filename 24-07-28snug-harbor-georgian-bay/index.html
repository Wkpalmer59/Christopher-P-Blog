<h1>Snug Harbor, Georgian Bay</h1>

<p>Yesterday we had fairly short run up the small boat channel to Snug Harbor, where we found a quiet and beautiful anchorage.</p>
<p>Along the way we continued to travel through narrow channels with rocks close by and some really beautiful houses.</p>

<p>We got in early enough to drop the dingy and do some exploring.</p>

<p>We got back to the boat and chilled out and took in the view.</p>

<p>We also saw some restless natives again.</p>

<p>While not one of the best sunsets we have seen, it was still pretty.</p>

<p>All was well and good until we woke up this morning and went out on the aft deck and found this.</p>

<p>That pile of bugs in the upper right corner of the step reminded Admiral of the old magnetic board game called Wooly Willie where you would use a magnetic pen to drag shavings to give the face beard, mustache and eyebrows...this boat was hairy! We had to use a good portion of our fresh water reserves hosing the boat off so we could crew and move on.</p>
<p>Today we headed to Byng Inlet where will stay in a marina and give the boat a good wash down and replenish water tanks.</p>
