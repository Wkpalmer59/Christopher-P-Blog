<h1>Bynge Inlet, Georgian Bay</h1>

<p>Yesterday we traveled about 40 miles up the small boat channel with some really narrow areas with rocks all around, but we got through unscathed. The scenery here continues to be beautiful. We did have to run outside for a while and deal with some 2-3‘ rollers coming in off the bay, unfortunately taking them on the starboard beam. We sped up some to smooth it out a little.</p>

<p>We arrived at Wright’s marina around 1:30 and spent a good portion of the afternoon cleaning the remaining bugs and spiders off the boat. Not very much to do here so we just relaxed, enjoyed happy hour drinks and appetizers with our boat buddies and dI’d some travel planning.</p>
<p>To day we will do about 20 miles out to the Bustard Islands which are supposed to be beautiful and will anchor there for the night. Hopefully we will not have a repeat of the bugs!🤞</p>
