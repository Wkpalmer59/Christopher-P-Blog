<h1>Killarney, ON</h1>

<p>We had heard and read a lot about Killarney and how great it was, but upon arriving there on Tuesday, we were not impressed. The marina was expensive and they packed us in on docks that are across the channel from the marina facilities and town. You have to take a water taxi to get to the other side or launch your dinghy. We had room to drop our dinghy, but couldn’t get through because of how packed in we were! We could literally reach out and touch the boat next to us. Another negative was a sailboat got tied up behind our buddy boat and they decided last minute they would be leaving closer to 11:00; we were ready to shove off by 9:00 (the time he told us the night before that he was leaving, before wifey decided she wanted to go to the general store).🤬</p>

<p>There is really nothing in the town except for one restaurant that supposedly serves the best fish and chips, a general store and a liquor store. Dennis and Colleen had the fish and chips and said they were good, but not something they would write home about, the general store was boring and the liquor store was picked pretty clean.</p>
<p>We did have a sighting of something rare.</p>

<p>We had booked two nights there, but quickly decided to move on and we are glad we did. We are now in Little Current and this is a great stop where we will spend two nights.</p>
