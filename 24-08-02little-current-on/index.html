<h1>Little Current, ON</h1>

<p>We spent two nights here in Little Current and were able to do some provisioning as the grocery store was close. This is a nice little town that gets it’s name from the east-west current from the entire north channel that flows though the narrows where the town is located. The current wasn’t running too bad while we were there so it didn’t give us a hard time.</p>
<p>We did have to wait for the swing bridge across the narrows as we approached the town. This is the first bridge we have encountered that is on a schedule since we left the waterway on the east coast. The bridge was originally a train bridge but was converted to a one lane bridge for vehicles and a traffic light is used to coordinate the traffic.</p>

<p>The town is small but has some great trails for walking, good restaurants, a brewery and is beautifully maintained.</p>

<p>Little Current is on Manitoulin Island and they are having their “Haweater“ festival this weekend. We learned that folks that are born on the island are considered Haweaters which is a term derived from the original settlers who ate hawberries for vitamin C to help ward off scurvy.</p>
<p>Today we were going to find an anchorage and then move on to Blind River tomorrow, but it looks like it is going to get windy tomorrow so we decided to do a longer day today since the wind is light, thus spending two nights in Blind River.</p>
