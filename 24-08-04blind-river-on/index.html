<p>This was a quiet stop with a nice marina and nice people, but not much to do. The downtown area was all of one block, but they did have a couple of bars, a liquor store a grocery store and a cool looking pharmacy that closed at 1:00 on Saturdays, so we missed out on that during our afternoon stroll.</p>
<p>It was a good place to sit out the little bit of a blow we had yesterday. There were quite a few Mainships on our dock with friendly owners joking we were taking over! This is also the furthest north we will go on our trip.</p>
