<p>Yesterday we traveled to Drummond Island mostly because it was a convenient stop to break up the long run to Mackinaw and was a good place to check in with customs.</p>
<p>We took down our Canadian courtesy flag and put up our quarantine flag as we entered US waters.</p>

<p>We noticed as we approached Drummond that the  water turned more of a beautiful turquoise color. We are not sure why.</p>
<p>The marina here is pretty nice, but there isn’t much to do. They have many large buildings that they use for inside heated storage for boats which is a thing up here.</p>

<p>We did our morning walk around the property and found this old barn behind the local museum.</p>

<p>Today we will head across Lake Huron to Mackinaw City, where we plan to spend a few days restocking and getting some projects done.</p>
