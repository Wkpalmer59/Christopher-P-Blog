<h1>Mackinaw City, MI</h1>
<p>We arrived in Mackinaw City on Monday and as we got closer we noticed that the water became much clearer and started to almost like we were in the Keys or Bahamas. We planned to stay here 3 days, but after reviewing the weather on Lake Michigan (which can be a bear), we decided to stay here until Monday. We can think of worse places to be stuck for a week.</p>

<p>We were immediately impressed with how much of a tourist mecca this place is. It is has all the amenities for a family vacation and is known as the gateway to Mackinac Island (more on that later).</p>

<p>On our morning walk we ventured out to the “Top of the Mitt” and got a great view of the “Mighty Mack” bridge that has become the official dividing line between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. We also got a close up view from the land side of one of the many light houses that are along the coastline in the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>Yesterday we took the ferry over to Mackinac Island which is famous for the fact that they banned automobiles from the start and the only available transportation is by horseback, horse drawn carriage, bicycle or walking.</p>

<p>There are over 500 horses on the island during the summer and when you get off the ferry you are immediately assaulted with the accompanying smell. We were told that they shovel more than 600 pounds of horse crap off the streets every day. 😷💩 Fortunately the tour schedules seemed to be pretty well dispersed so our senses weren’t assaulted much more after our initial debarking. We even witnessed a wedding with a white coach for the bride!</p>
<p>The island is beautiful with many sights to see. We opted to just walk around and visited some of the sites. The arch rock has both a geological and an Indian legend to explain how it was formed.</p>

<p>The highlight of our walk about was a visit to the famous Grand Hotel, which is known for the world’s largest outdoor porch.</p>

<p>Upon entering, we were told that we had to pay $12 per person just to enter the hotel to partake at one of the 14 bars inside. We then heard a voice from behind say “or you can just follow me”. A very nice guest at the hotel led the 4 of us into the hotel as her guests. 😊 So we headed to the top floor and had over priced drinks at the bar, but justified it by telling ourselves we saved $48 getting in.😉 We headed out soon thereafter as there is a dress code after 6pm where gentlemen are required to wear ties &amp; jackets.</p>

<p>This hotel is also where the film Somewhere In Time was filmed starring Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour. Of course we watched the movie after we got back to the boat. It was fun seeing everything we had just seen in person in the movie.</p>
<p>Unfortunately our re-provisioning options are not great here since there is only a small General Store nearby and Uber appears to be unavailable. We will make do and hopefully restock at our next port, of which place and time is still to be determined.</p>
