<p>We finally got out of Mackinaw City yesterday and for a good part of the day we had 2-3 foot waves hitting our bow and beam making traversing around on the boat a bit of a challenge. We made it down to Charlevoix late afternoon. Upon entering though, we had to travel through a narrow canal at the same time as a huge ferry; Admiral practically could’ve shaken hands with tourists walking on that sidewalk! A little harrowing to say the least…a picture would’ve been pretty cool but we were both busy!😅</p>

<p>We are spending two nights here as this is a nice little town with lots to do.</p>

<p>There is also a a good grocery store about a block away. They sell liquor in the grocery stores here and they had a good selection. We filled our shopping cart and proceeded to wheel it right down the street and out to the boat. I’m sure we were a sight to see!😜 It was so convenient that we made two trips and stocked up on food, water and libations of course!</p>
<p>On our walk this morning we found the famous ’Mushroom Houses‘ which are unique vacation rentals that are on the Lake Michigan shore here.</p>

<p>We has planned to go toTraverse City tomorrow, but we could only get in for one night and it is a long trip down and back up Grand Traverse Bay. Also, there is another storm coming through this weekend so we decided to skip Traverse City and go to Leland to wait out the blow. Hope we like it as it looks as though we may be stuck there until Monday.</p>
