<h1>Leland, MI</h1>

<p>We had a nice calm ride down to Leland from  Charlevoix yesterday. We continue to be amazed by how clear the water is. At one point the Captain could see bottom and had to check the depth sounder only to find out we were in 25 feet of water!</p>

<p>Leland is an old fish town and has maintained some of its charm.</p>

<p>While walking in town yesterday we came across a distillery with this sign out front. The Admiral maybe dropping the Captain off here at 10am if we stay much longer. 😊</p>

<p>At this point we are not sure how long we will stay here. Captain is finding it difficult to decipher the local wind and wave forecasts in this fickle lake. We have become fair weather sailors in our retired-ass years and wish to avoid rough waters, but we have wonderings if this big ole lake may or may not have a rough ride in our future.😲 Frankfort is the next stop on our list.</p>
