<p>We had a nice calm ride down to Muskegon yesterday for a quick overnight. We were not able to get into the municipal marina downtown, so we stayed at a marina that was quite far from downtown. Therefore we didn’t get a chance to do any exploring of their downtown. We did venture into a distillery nearby the marina and also a local pub, however, we walked in and out of both. US walking out of libation stations tells you a lot!</p>
<p>For the first time on this trip we have been having trouble finding slips on the weekend. We believe it is because the locals are getting in their last licks on their short season.</p>
<p>On the way into the harbor we passed a World War II submarine that was pretty cool.</p>

<p>Closer to the marina we passed the Milwaukee Clipper ferry which has been turned into a museum. The Admiral has always told the story of how her family traveled on a ferry from Muskegon to Milwaukee and Lake Michigan was so rough, nearly everyone on the ferry was getting sick.🤮This was that nefarious ferry!</p>

<p>Today we did a short run down to Grand Haven where we found a home for the weekend at a marina that is a little ways away from town but walkable &amp; accessible by dinghy as well.</p>
<p>We had this ‘fun‘ getting out of the harbor as we left this morning. This must be where ALL the fish were! We were surprised this is allowed to happen where all these people can fish smack in the middle of a navigable channel.</p>
