<h1>Grand Haven, MI</h1>

<p>We had a short but somewhat rocky ride down from Muskegon to Grand Haven on Friday and we stayed at a large 300 slip Safe Harbor marina for two nights.</p>

<p>We have to admit we are always impressed by the facilities and services provided at this chain of marinas. They had a pool, gym, club house and even playground for the kids. They also had a happy hour on Friday with free beer, wine and snacks and then had a free continental breakfast in the morning. The only downside was that it was not close to town, although we were able to dinghy over to the town marina.</p>
<p>On Sunday we moved to the town marina so we could better explore downtown and enjoy the nightly water fountain show.</p>

<p>Here’s a video of the fountain in action: https://youtu.be/Nl1poLL0wFE</p>
<p>We had a rather large yacht pull in next to us, with an interesting group on board. The captain looked like Jerry Garcia and he could barely get on and off the boat. The person we assumed was the owner gave us the impression he had recently come into money. (Youngster that stood around watching elderly captain struggle with power cord &amp; everything else involved in settling into a slip). The name of the boat was Yachts A Luck. 🙄</p>

<p>Today we are taking a longer run down to South Haven in an effort to get closer to Chicago. We are both done with the uncertainty of the weather on the lake and ready to get into the river system where we don’t have to worry so much about the weather.</p>
