<p>On Tuesday we left the state of Michigan and arrived in Indiana. We also crossed into the central time zone which was kind of a surprise to us as we never really thought about the fact that we would cross time zones as part of this trip. It didn’t really hit us until we realized our phones and watches had a different time than the analog ship’s clock. We will be in central time for the next couple of months until we get down to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>There isn’t a lot to do here but we did get inexpensive fuel, took an Uber to a Meijer (like a Walmart Supercenter only better) and then went to the beach where we swam in Lake Michigan for the first and last time. 😊</p>

<p>On our morning walk in the nearby park, we did see that they had a zoo and heard a few animals, but we didn’t visit it.</p>
<p>After fueling up, the Captain updated the fuel log and looked at some stats. We have traveled 2,978 nautical miles (3,427 statute miles) since we got fuel in Palm Beach right before our official loop starting point of Port St. Lucie. That includes our side trips up the St. John’s River and also into Long Island Sound to Milford. The screen shot below shows our track so far.</p>

<p>Today we are headed to Chicago where we will spend Labor Day weekend. We didn’t really want be traveling over a holiday weekend, so we made reservations there several weeks ago. We will collect some stuff that we had shipped there and do some more provisioning before we start the next leg of our trip down the inland rivers.</p>
