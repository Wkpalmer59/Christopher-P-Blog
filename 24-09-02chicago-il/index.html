<p>Buckle up buttercup, this is going to be a long one.</p>
<p>We arrived in the Chicago area on Thursday and stayed the first night at a marina on the south side.😳 We were eager to take advantage of weather and get across the lake so we arrived a day early and couldn’t add on to our Friday to Tuesday Labor Day weekend reservation at the downtown marina. The first marina was huge as are most of the marinas in this area. There wasn’t much to do there, but it was a good spot to spend the night (so long as you didn’t wander too far from marina area).</p>

<p>On Friday we moved to the DuSable Harbor Marina which is right in the heart of downtown. Lots of activity here with lots to do. Not being city people we were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed it here. Being in the middle of the so called “Gold Coast“ we were amazed by how clean they keep this part of the city with the amount of people that traverse through. We were also not as concerned for our safety walking around here as this seems to be a very popular area for walking and running the boardwalk running along side the marina.</p>

<p>On Friday we walked over to the Navy Pier and took in the sites there. Since it was Jimmy Buffet day we had to stop for a margarita.</p>

<p>On Saturday night we stayed up past our bed time to watch fireworks and our first ever drone show. The fireworks were not that impressive, but we really liked the drone show! It was worth staying up for.</p>
<p>Here are some videos</p>

<p>On Sunday Greg and Barb drove down to see us and after the challenge of finding this marina along with a place to park, they finally made it down to the boat.</p>

<p>We had a great time reminiscing and catching up over cocktails. Afterward, we walked over to the Navy Pier which was the most packed it had been all weekend! However, we did get lucky and happened upon 4 stools at the bar at Harry Caray’s (the famous sportscaster who called games for the White Sox and Cubs). We were happy to see that they had Chicago style hot dogs on the menu which was a goal for us. Greg was determined to make this happen in his backyard so thanks again!😋</p>

<p>During one of our walks we found an awesome grocery store which is an easy walk through a beautiful park so we were able to stock up utilizing our cart to get some heavier stuff like water. This city is very walking friendly. The side lanes are very clearly marked going two ways for pedestrians, while bikes and rickshaws share the middle lanes; “stay in your lane Linda!” is strongly advised as those rickshaw drivers are no joke! The park we walked through has a pretty nice area for dogs &amp; a fun looking playground with a splash pad for the littles.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will do our lasts 13 miles on Lake Michigan and will enter the Calumet River which is the beginning of our trip down the inland rivers.</p>
