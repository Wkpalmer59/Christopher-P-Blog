<p>Long day! We pushed off from Chicago at 6:30 this morning and caught a nice sunrise. However Lake Michigan gave us a final unpleasant ride for the 11 miles we needed to do to get to the entrance to the inland rivers. We had 2-4‘ seas on the nose. Once we arrived at the river entrance the Admiral turned around and declared, “F*#k You Lake Michigan“! It‘s a gorgeous lake but quite fickle!</p>
<p>From there we passed through many bridges and two locks. Not the most interesting part of our trip so far. Although one of the many bridges we went through is the one that sets the height limitation for the entire loop; a fixed19.5 foot bridge, we are 19 feet.</p>

<p>It appears that we are going to be spending the next few weeks dealing with commercial tugs and barges. We left Chicago at 6:30 and tied up in Joliet at 5:45! They held us up several times today as we navigated the canal and two locks. Even though we arrived at the lock first, commercial traffic gets priority so we were asked to kindly step aside. Well of course we did and then had to wait for the barge that radioed the lock to even arrive to the lock, which was only traveling at about 3 knots. Upon the arrival of said barge, we then watched as the tug struggled to manuever 9 large containers into the lock. All said and done, we ended up with a 2 hour delay before our 2nd lock. The name of the barge was Donna Furlong; we wait for Donna FurLong time!</p>

<p>Our first lock only lowered us about 2 feet, but the second one was 38 feet! We had 4 other boats in the lock with us, so they rafted one of the boats with our buddy boat due to the limited tie up options on the wall. This is the same lock we went into after the barge with the huge load.</p>
<p>We spent the night on a free wall in Joliet, which was not the quietest place, but not a bad spot.</p>

<p>Seems like our options for good stops will be limited as we work our way down the rivers. Today we are headed to Ottawa.</p>
