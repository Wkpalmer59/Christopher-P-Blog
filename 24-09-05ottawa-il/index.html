<p>We had a nice uneventful ride down from Joliet. The weather was perfect as well as our timing of the 3 locks we went through. It was a pretty ride down river where we passed some cute little houseboats.</p>

<p>We also passed a few more barges whose loads were so large we were amazed by the maneuverability these tug captains are able to manage!</p>

<p>Also along the way, we saw something cutting across our bow that was leaving a wake. After a look through binoculars, we realized it was a buck swimming to the other side!</p>

<p>Another shout out to the kids for the great equipment we have on board with which we are able to capture moments such as this! Thanks again Kait &amp; Pat for the camera and thanks Alyssa, K &amp;P for the binoculars!</p>
<p>We have been enjoying the ease of the locks in this river. We just need to get a line around what they call a floater and secure both ends of the line on two midship cleats. The floater moves up or down with the boat pretty much eliminating the need to manhandle the boat due to winds or cable instability.</p>

<p>We attended a very informative briefing meeting last night graciously offered by a local about the route along the rivers from where we were all the way to Kentucky. The person who held the meeting has been running this section of the rivers all his life, was a tow captain, now works for Army Corp of Engineers and is in charge of one of the local locks. We were glad we chose to attend as we learned a lot about our upcoming travel area and he was even so kind as to share his number if we have any questions along the way. Most marinas and locals appreciate Loopers coming through their backyards and are very welcoming and accommodating. We sure do appreciate it!</p>
<p>Today we are headed to Henry, IL.</p>
