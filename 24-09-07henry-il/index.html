<p>On Thursday we had an uneventful run from Ottawa to Henry. We were told that we would be tying up to a rather rough old lock wall and they were not kidding. We likened ourselves to mountain goats walking on the wall to meet up with our buddy boat friends. The marina owners took this place over because it was going to be shut down. Her &amp; her family all have full time jobs but took this over because they too are boaters and wanted fellow boaters to have a place to spend the night. She designs cabinets and has a boat tied to the wall named ‘The Office’. It is tied up on the far end of the wall in the picture below.</p>

<p>We did have power and water so it wasn’t too bad. We walked into downtown Henry, which is all of about 4 blocks. Not much to do here.</p>
