<p>On Friday we arrived in Peoria and the Illinois Valley Yacht Club (IVY Club). Our boat buddies have friends that live here and were gracious enough to come down and ferry us to Costco and the grocery store so we could stock up and show us also around Peoria. Tim and Lila are really nice people and we enjoyed meeting and hanging out with them.</p>

<p>During the briefing we sat in on in Ottawa, Bryce told us that we needed to go to Kuchie’s on the water in Peoria for the shipwreck Bloody Mary. We decided it would be fun to extend our stay another day so we could do Sunday Funday and celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.</p>

<p>We put together some pictures of us over the 46 years we have been together for those of you who are interested. Here’s a link:  https://1drv.ms/a/s!AppnuJBgDzKygvR6uTmu-0ptsV7YlA</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will continue our journey down the rivers.</p>
