<h1>Havana and Beardstown, IL</h1>

<p>Yesterday we traveled from Peoria to an anchorage just north of Havana that was recommended in the briefing we got. It was a well protected spot off the main river channel with plenty of water, plenty of room for quite a few boats and perfect mileage wise to break up our runs into manageable segments.</p>

<p>We had a nice peaceful evening, but woke up to the boat covered with hundreds of mayflies.</p>

<p>The captain broke out the battery operated leaf blower (yes, we have one on board as it was recommended on the loop forum for just this purpose) and started blowing the flies off the boat. He was surprised to see that there was a flock of swallows that quickly swooped in to scoop the flies out of the air as they blew off the boat!</p>
<p>Today we did a short run down to Beardstown and tied up at the Logsdon Tug Service. This was another spot recommended in the briefing. We were forewarned that we would be tying up to tugs or barges as there are limited amounts of spots to tie up for the night as we head down the rivers. They were not kidding!</p>

<p>Beardstown is kind of a run down town, however, they have beautiful buildings which will bode well for the beautification project that is currently underway. We witnessed many working projects as we walked through the town.The reviews for Beardstown talked about a great Mexican restaurant called Little Mexico. It was about a 1/2 mile walk so we went for it. Glad we did as it was one of the best Mexican restaurants we‘ve been to and we also have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow.😋</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will spend our last day on the Illinois River and stay at an anchorage.</p>
