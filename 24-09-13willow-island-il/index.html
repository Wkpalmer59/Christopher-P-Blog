<p>On Wednesday night we anchored in a quiet anchorage behind Willow Island with 5 other boats. It was very peaceful and we didn’t wake up to any bugs!</p>

<p>Yesterday we left the Illinois River and joined the mighty Mississippi River. We traveled down to Alton, IL which is just north of St. Louis. We will spend 6 days here so we can get a chance to see St. Louis (there aren’t any marinas in downtown St. Louis) and we also need to slow our roll a little to remain on our loose schedule. Our boat buddies have some friends from the area that we have some weekend plans with.</p>
