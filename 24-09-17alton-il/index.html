<h1>Alton, IL</h1>

<p>We arrived in Alton on the Mississippi on Thursday a settled in for an extended stay. This is a large marina which is eerily empty, but there are quite a few loopers coming and going. It is a well maintained marina and is close to the downtown area, although there is not a lot going on here. We did go to a very large farmers market on Saturday morning that was right near the marina and happily helped to support them by purchasing fresh produce and a jarred spicy mustard.</p>

<p>On our morning walk we learned about some of the floods that have plagued this area from the mighty Mississippi. We turned around after reading the history of the great flood of ’93 and couldn’t believe how high above us the town was as we stood by the riverbank! We literally walked quite a bit uphill to get into the downtown where the silo we took a photo of has a painted line of the water level during that time.</p>

<p>We rented a car on Friday so we could have some freedom and do some stocking up at Costco and the local grocery.</p>
<p>On Saturday we drove to the St. Charles waterfront area that has a rich history and was the first state capital of Missouri. Very cool town with a lot of history and there was also an art festival which we stumbled upon and enjoyed perusing the many talented artist booths.</p>

<p>On Sunday our boat buddies had two couple friends from Missouri join us and they took us into St. Louis to watch a Chiefs game at a sports bar and yes, we were happy to cheer on the Chiefs!</p>

<p>After the game they took us to an area called “The Hill” which is akin to Wooster St. in New Haven with its Italian heritage and many Italian restaurants. We ate at Mama’s on the Hill and had a the best Italian meals! Every single thing brought to the table was devoured with gusto! We were pleasantly surprised as well with how great the service was for a party of 8.</p>

<p>Since we had a car, the following day we decided to do the tourist thing and drive back into St. Louis to do the arch tour. We are really glad we did as the history alone of how it was built was nothing short of amazing! We’ve seen pictures of the arch and of course associate it with St. Louis but had no idea what an incredible feat of engineering it was and that it took over 3 years to complete…oh, and a lot of brass balls belonging to those steel workers too! It was predicted there would be an average of 13 deaths associated with the building of this arch but thankfully there were zero.</p>
