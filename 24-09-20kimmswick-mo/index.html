<p>We left Alton yesterday and traveled down the Mississippi past St. Louis and the arch. It was cool to see the arch from the water and get our picture taken.</p>

<p>After passing through St. Louis we stopped at one of the less glamorous but infamous stops. Hoppie’s Marine Service is nothing but a couple of barges tied together and anchored near shore with a ramp to get to shore. They do have power, water and fuel and it is the only stop for a long stretch, so we pretty much had to stop there.</p>

<p>This morning we walked through the small but interesting town.</p>

<p>We also walked past the Anheuser estate and yes, Fred’s great grandfather was the founder of the Anheuser brewing company.</p>

<p>Between here and Paducah there aren’t any marinas, so our options are somewhat limited. Today we are headed for a free wall at a lock.</p>
