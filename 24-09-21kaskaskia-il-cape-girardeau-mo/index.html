<p>Last night we tied up to a free wall below the lock on the Kaskaskia River where it joins the Mississippi. We were there with 4 other boats and it was a quiet and peaceful spot. However, it was quite warm and we did not have power, so it was a little uncomfortable. We did run the AC off the generator for a while which helped cool the cabins down, so doing that along with using a fan, it wasn’t too bad.</p>

<p>Tonight we are anchored in Little Diversion Canal in Cape Girardeau which was recommended in our briefing at Hoppie’s. We are here with the same four boats and are hoping for another peaceful evening.</p>
