<h1>Olmsted Lock and Dam, KY</h1>

<p>Today we did our last 40 miles on the Mississippi through a lot of bends and passing several large “Tows” which are tugs pushing many barges. We saw one today with 20 barges.</p>

<p>We left the Mississippi and headed up the Ohio River where we immediately noticed how much clearer &amp; cleaner the water looked after the muddy debris filled waters of the Mississippi. Unfortunately we lost the 2.5 knot current push we had in the Mississippi and now have a 1 knot current against us that we will have until our next destination. We anchored just below the Olmsted Lock which we will go through first thing tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we have about 30 miles to go after we pass through the lock to reach Paducah where we will spend two nights at a marina. We will be glad to plant our feet on solid ground after 3 nights in a row of not having access.</p>
