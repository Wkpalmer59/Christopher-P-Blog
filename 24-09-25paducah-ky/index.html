<h1>Paducah, KY</h1>

<p>When we first planned on stopping at Paducah (which we’d never heard of pre-loop) we thought it would be just another place to tie up for the night. Turns out this is a great place with a lot of history. We are glad we booked two nights here. We first noticed what an elaborate set up they have for the marina since they evidently get some serious floods here. We have also been told they’re not finished.</p>

<p>When you walk into town you see the flood wall they have built and we heard rumors that the water has come over the wall.</p>

<p>They have decorated the town side of the wall with a series of 50 murals depicting Paducah’s history. Most murals have a lighted marker with an explanation of the painted scene in front of it.</p>

<p>Paducah also boasts the most historic markers per capita than any other Kentucky town. (While we stopped to read many, we only took pictures of a few; you’re welcome)!😊</p>

<p>The town has some great architecture with lots of shops, restaurants, art galleries and even the National Quilt Museum.</p>

<p>While we were a bit hesitant, we decided to visit The National Quilt Museum and we are glad we did. It was quite fascinating in the fact that we had no idea of all the different quilting styles and techniques. Some use photographs to replicate, others use fabric shapes to create the colors or patterns intended and there are so many more styles to speak of, including Sunshine Joe (Mallard) who got his start threading needles for Granny who couldn’t see well. We only took pictures of a few, but there were so many very impressive works of art made out of thousands of separate pieces of fabric.</p>

<p>We had decided that we really liked Paducah until we got up this morning and ventured outside. Another Mayfly attack 10 times worse than the last one which ramped it up to liken an infestation…it will take us weeks to get them all off of the boat!</p>

<p>Today we traveled up the Cumberland River to the Green Turtle Bay Resort in Grand Rivers, KY where we will stay for a week most likely cleaning the boat for the majority of that time.😅</p>
