<p>On Wednesday we traveled from Paducah to Grand Rivers which was kind of a long haul up the Cumberland River against about a 2 knot current. We did get lucky at the Barkley lock though, which was open and waiting for us when we got there. We pulled into the Green Turtle Bay Resort which is somewhat of a looper Mecca. We are here with at least 20 other loopers. They provide a discount on fuel for loopers and offer courtesy vans that we can take into town for supplies. If you’ve ever read the book If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, same concept here, if you offer a looper a good deal, chances are many will come and docktails will happen! We enjoyed meeting many fellow loopers we’ve seen along the way, along with a few others. After that, since it was taco Thursday at the tiki bar on site we headed there for tacos &amp; came upon the chance to win “wonderful” prizes in a rousing game of Bingo.🤣 Fun &amp; funny all at once!</p>

<p>We spent a good portion of Thursday cleaning mayfly guts off the boat and in the process we found a couple of hitchhikers.</p>

<p>We think they climbed onboard up the bridle while we were anchored at the Olmsted lock. The Captain spotted one jump ship when we were getting ready to pull anchor.</p>
<p>We spent yesterday hunkered down in the boat as it rained all day with the remnants of Helene. All in all it wasn’t bad, we are well protected here and we only got a little bit of wind.</p>
<p>We are scheduled to be here until Wednesday, which is good as we expect the rivers will be loaded with logs that will get washed into them from the shores with all the rain for the next few days.</p>
<p>When we depart here on Wednesday, we will travel further up the Cumberland on our way to Nashville.</p>
