<h1>Lake Barkley, KY</h1>

<p>Yesterday we left Green Turtle Bay and traveled down Lake Barkley to Lake Barkley Marina near Little River. Along the way we passed the Kentucky State Penitentiary, which from a distance looked more like a resort until we got up close and could see the guard towers and barbed wire.</p>

<p>As we planned this trip and read through the forums, we kept hearing about “dead heads” which we had never heard of before, but basically they are just water logged logs that float straight up and down and can be hard to see. Unfortunately, most of the rivers we’re traveling are fraught with these hazards which we are constantly on the lookout for. The muddy waters don’t help.</p>

<p>The Lake Barkley marina is interesting because all the docks are covered making for a rather dark environment and everything echos, but the locals seem to like it and have personalized elaborate setups around their boats with grills, outdoor furniture, plants and places to park their golf carts making it a home away from home. They evidently party pretty hard here on the weekends.</p>
