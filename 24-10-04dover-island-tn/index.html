<p>Yesterday we continued through Lake Barkley on our way to Nashville and crossed over into Tennessee on the Cumberland River. One of the things that has surprised us is the abundance of Asian Carp, which is an invasive species. They are quite large and jump out of the water when disturbed. We have had them hit the boat so hard we thought we hit a log. We haven’t been able to catch a pic of one of them in the air, but we did happen upon some fishermen netting a bunch of them.</p>

<p>Our anchorage was very peaceful and we only had one other boat join us.</p>
