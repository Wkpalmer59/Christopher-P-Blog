<p>Yesterday we tied up at a free dock below the Riverview Restaurant. Once we got settled we discovered that there was a concert in the park across the river with a Journey tribute band that was actually very good.</p>

<p>We had dinner at the restaurant which had very good ratings but we were not impressed.</p>
<p>We did feel safe here as we had a guard groundhog keeping watch over the boat from the bank.</p>

<p>Last night while we were watching TV after dinner we played a rousing game of “what’s that noise”. We kept hearing loud banging and thumping coming from the bilge. After some investigation we determined it wasn’t anything mechanical. It stopped after a while but kept coming back intermittently during the night, which did not help our sleep. After some googling this morning we determined that it was the carp banging up against the boat while they are eating the algae off the bottom. Hope we don’t continue to have them as visitors.</p>
<p>Today we will finish our journey up the Cumberland River and tie up at a marina just outside of Nashville, TN.</p>
