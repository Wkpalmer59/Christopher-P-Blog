<p>On Sunday we arrived at a marina on the west side of Nashville on the Cumberland River about 8 miles from downtown Nashville. There is a municipal marina right in downtown, but we have heard some horror stories about boats being boarded in the middle of the night by unsavory characters so we opted for the safer option outside of downtown, especially since we will be leaving the boat here for a few days while we fly home for a wedding.</p>
<p>Yesterday we took an Uber to Broadway downtown and arrived around 10:30 am. We were instantly amazed at the activity on a Monday morning with a live bands playing in just about every bar, with some having bands on multiple floors. We visited quite a few and all the bands were very good. Our favorite was in Kid Rock’s Big Honky Tonk Steak House where we spent the most amount of time enjoying the music there.</p>
<p>Many of the bars had roof top areas where you can look down on the craziness.</p>

<p>We spent today cleaning the boat and prepping her for a few days on her own. We fly out on Thursday and will be back on Monday. We are keeping a close eye on Milton to see how it will affect our travel plans when we head down that way in November. Our thoughts and prayers are with those folks that will be affected by this storm and are still recovering from the last one.</p>
