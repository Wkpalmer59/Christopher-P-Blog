<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Just a quick update as we are still here in Nashville. We flew home last weekend to attend a wedding of the daughter of close friends of ours and had a great time. We also got a chance to visit with our own daughters.</p>

<p>While we were in CT, we received a phone call from Cocoa Village Marina giving us the unfortunate news that the dock for our winter home as of the last 3 years sustained damage and they wouldn’t be able to rent us our slip. We have grown very fond of Cocoa Village over the years &amp; were saddened by the news. However, with all the devastation impacting so many, we realize our problem is minor in comparison, but still, that left us “outdoors ya know”! Phone calls were made to FL friends first, then marinas where we might want to winter. We were worried because slips were hard to find before all the storms of late and didn’t have a lot of hope, however, third marina called had one 50’ spot left! Best part is, it‘s on Merritt Island right across from Cocoa Village, close to Cocoa Beach, close to rocket launch site, has a pool, restaurant &amp; laundry on site and best of all, close to dear friends, Clark &amp; Susan!🥰</p>
<p>After our return back to Nashville, we heard that the lock we need to go though to get back to the loop route was closed for repairs, so we figured we would stay here until Monday, especially since we had paid the monthly rate so the slip is already paid for. We heard today that the lock is back up, but we decided to just stick with a Monday departure as we do not want to get down to the Gulf Of Mexico until we are reasonably sure the hurricanes are done and also giving more time for some of the marinas in Florida a chance to recover. This is a comfortable place with a floating restaurant that plays good music and also has beautiful sunsets.</p>
