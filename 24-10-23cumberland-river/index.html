<h1>Cumberland River</h1>

<p>We are heading back down the Cumberland River from Nashville to get back to the regular Loop route. Yesterday we left Nashville and went through the Cheatham lock (Captain can’t help but associate the name Cheatham with Dewey, Cheatham and Howe law firm 😂) and stopped in Clarksville. (Another association, “Last Train”…you’re welcome for the ear worm).</p>
<p>We changed our plans once we arrived at our anchorage spot and it was only 1:00, we decided it was too early and decided to push on. We continued our trip on to the Lake Barkley Marina and tomorrow we will arrive back in Green Turtle Bay. The fall foliage is just beginning around here, but it’s still quite pretty. We were apparently being used for a tactical training exercise by a local army base helicopter.</p>

<p>We also spotted several flocks of pelicans, which surprised us. After some google searching we learned that the American White Pelican does in fact migrate through Kentucky.</p>

<p>We will spend two or three nights in Green Turtle Bay before we continue our trek south on the Tennessee-Tombigee waterway to the Gulf.</p>
