<p>On Tuesday we continued up the Tennessee River to Pickwick Lake. We passed quite a few houses that were up on cliffs over looking the river, including one that looked like it was ready to fall into the river.</p>

<p>We went through our first lock since leaving Nashville which had about a 30’ rise. There was a pretty decent current approaching the lock and the wind was blowing pretty good too, so instead of jockeying around, we decided to tie up to the wall below the lock while we waited for the gates to open. It got a little sporty as they started dumping the water out of the lock making handling the boat and lines a bit more challenging. Here’s a video:</p>

<p>As we exited the lock we came out into Pickwick lake which is beautiful.</p>

<p>We are tied up at a marina in Iuka that has courtesy cars, so we are able to do some provisioning. We had originally planned to spend two nights, but our buddy boat is having some work done so we decided to add another day. We are also watching a potential storm that is brewing in the Caribbean Sea which may head into the Gulf next week, so we are going to slow our roll some as we keep an eye on that. We do get some nice sunrises here.</p>

<p>After we leave here we will begin descending the Tenn-Tom waterway “escalator“ down bound to the Gulf. We will go through 12 more locks dropping 341 feet with one lock dropping us 84 feet!</p>
