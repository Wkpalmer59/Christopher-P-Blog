<h1>Fulton, MS</h1>

<p>On Friday we left Iuka (eye-oo-ka) and               entered the Tenn-Tom waterway. The first 24 miles or so was just a canal and was pretty boring.</p>

<p>We came out of the canal into Bay Springs Lake and tied up at the Bay Springs Marina for the night. Saturday morning we got up early and scrambled to get together with nine other boats to form a flotilla to go through three locks in a 14 mile stretch. The first lock was the Jamie L. Whitten lock that dropped us 84 feet.</p>
<p>Here is a video from the GoPro camera. It is at 4x speed to cut it down to 4 minutes.</p>

<p>We arrived in Fulton at Midway Marina around noon time and spent some time at the fuel dock while staff got all the boats settled and waited for a pump out. There were 16 boats total that landed here throughout the day, so of course there was a pretty large docktail party!</p>

<p>One of the many boats here happened to be a couple we made friends with as they were passing through Cocoa on their 1999 Mainship 430 a little over 2 years ago. Although we’ve stayed in touch with them over the years, it was nice to visit &amp; catch up with them.</p>

<p>Last night a group of fellow loopers gathered around a fire pit which was cozy and fun and the boat that organized the get together had the foresight to bring skewers, marshmallows, chocolate &amp; graham crackers so we enjoyed cocktails and s’mores!</p>

<p>On a morning walk, we passed a giant truck tire swing and of course the Admiral had to go for a ride.</p>

<p>After our two nights here, we will continue our trip ‘down the escalator’today with a smaller flotilla of only 4. We are watching what will most likely become Rafael down in the Caribbean to see if we need to slow down some more before we get down to the Gulf Coast. Next stop for the night is an anchorage just above the Armory Lock in Armory, MS.</p>
