<p>On Monday we moved on from Midway and found a beautiful and very peaceful anchorage just off the waterway. On Tuesday we continued south and stopped at a marina in Columbus, MS for two nights where we utilized their courtesy car to get some supplies and also had an opportunity to get some laundry done. We were there with quite a few other loopers. It seems to be that we are starting to bunch up as everyone slows their roll headed down to the Gulf.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, it looks like Rafael is headed west toward Mexico and shouldn’t interfere with our plans. There is another storm brewing but it has a low chance of developing at this point; we will keep an eye on it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Yesterday we left Columbus and crossed the border into Alabama and found another good anchorage just above our next lock In Pickensville. Since we arrived pretty early in the afternoon, we took the opportunity to launch the dinghy and stretch its legs since we haven’t used it in a while. There is a nice park here that we can dinghy over to in the morning so we can get a walk in.</p>

<p>We only have four more locks to do before we hit Mobile. After that we have another four on the  Okeechobee Waterway and then we are done with locks!</p>
<p>Today we will move on to another anchorage near our next lock.</p>
