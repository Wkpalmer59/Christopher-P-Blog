<h1>Continuing Down The Tombigbee</h1>
<p>On Friday we found a great anchorage and spent the night with 8 other boats.</p>

<p>On Saturday we traveled to Kingfisher Bay Marina in Demopolis, AL where we spent two nights.</p>
<p>Along the way we went past the “White Cliffs of Epes” which were quite impressive.</p>

<p>While in Demopolis we got to use another ‘fabulous‘ courtesy car to reprovision before multiple upcoming anchorages. That night, we got a ride into town and had a pleasant dinner with our boat buddies at a recommended Mexican restaurant.</p>
<p>We left Demopolis yesterday and with a plan to check on the feasibility of a few anchorage choices. We were traveling about 95 miles and as we went through our first lock of the day, we were in the company of 8 other Loopers, so upon exiting the lock, we made the decision to burn some fuel and put some distance between us and the pack. We traveled at 15 knots for about 2 hours, then cut back to about 9.5 knots in the effort to try and be anchored before sundown. Unfortunately, the anchorages weren’t optimal for us as they were narrow and we wanted to avoid having to use our unwieldy stern anchor. ‘Lucky‘ for us though, Bobby’s Fishcamp about 8 miles up had open dock space with power.</p>

<p>We shoved off this morning and headed for our last lock in the river system which was very exciting for us since we’ve gone through over 100 locks during this trip and are pretty ‘locked out’ at this point! We did enjoy watching this egret though! When we entered the lock it was perched on the top rail. As we began dropping, it hopped down as each level became available searching for a fresh meal at every level! After watching what it did, it occurred to us that he’s learned how to utilize the lock as his local seafood restaurant.🐟</p>

<p>Today was a cloudy and at some points rainy travel day as we head to an anchorage on the Tensaw River.</p>
