<h1>Mobile, AL</h1>

<p>We had planned on arriving in Mobile on Wednesday but as we were traveling down the last stretch of the river the weather forecast deteriorated for Mobile Bay (25-30 knot winds) so we decided to anchor 12 miles up the river and wait for the winds to calm down. We went into what looked like a great anchorage with our buddy boat and one other boat. The anchor set fine and we were well protected from the wind. However, when we got up in the morning the Admiral looked out our aft cabin door and said, “I don’t think we are supposed to be here”…</p>

<p>Since we are now back in tidal waters, the current switched during the night and the anchor didn’t reset and we dragged a good 1/4 mile up the creek and into the mud on the side. We were pretty hard aground and stern in so we couldn’t even attempt to get ourselves off, so time to call Boat US! We called at 6:15 am, they were there by 8 and had free within 10 minutes!</p>

<p>Capt. Trevor did a great job and was very professional.</p>
<p>Here are a couple videos.</p>

<p>Fortunately we had no damage or vibration, we were on our way no later than we had already planned and it didn’t cost us a penny! Got to love that Boat US membership. It is a no brainer at $215/annually. Can’t imagine what that would have cost without it.</p>
<p>Our boat buddy dragged their anchor as well but didn’t go aground. As we were waiting for Boat US to arrive we watched huge clusters of grass floating by which got wrapped up in the anchor line of both our buddy boat and the other boat, Irish Mist.</p>

<p>Our buddy boat was finally able to get clear but Irish Mist didn’t do so well; while trying to free their boat they ended up getting their anchor chain wrapped around their prop and some how broke their shaft and lost their propeller. Capt. Trevor had to tow them across the bay to a marina after helping us.</p>
<p>As we continued down the river we passed through downtown Mobile.</p>

<p>We arrived in Dog River late morning got fuel and a pump out and then tied up in a less than optimal spot, but it was better than anchoring for yet another night. We met up with some other loopers for happy hour, then headed back to boat for dinner and an early night after our eventful day.</p>
<p>Our next stop is Pensacola, FL where we have plans to visit with cousin Kara and Steve.</p>
