<p>We came out of Dog River on Friday and headed out into Mobile Bay where the waters were pretty muddy and bumpy and we spent a good part of our morning dodging logs in the channel. Once we cut into the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway the waters smoothed right out. We are thrilled to be back in sunny Florida with pelicans diving for fish, dolphins swimming in our wake, and the views of beautiful blue water, sandy beaches and palm trees!</p>

<p>We also passed Lulu’s, which is a restaurant owned by the late Jimmy Buffets sister.</p>

<p>We tied up early afternoon in a beautiful and peaceful marina right in downtown Pensacola. That evening we met up with cousin Kara and her husband Steve for what was promised to be a fantastic dining experience. Kara made reservations at Jackson’s restaurant and requested their favorite server, for what she explained would be “dinner and a show”. Well Thomas was quite a character with an entertaining flair for describing particular menu items. Kara and Steve did not exaggerate; as Steve so eloquently put it, the man could make a dirty diaper sound appetizing! (The Burnt Ends did in fact smell like a campfire!) All in all, it was an incredible dining experience between the excellent food we ate, the engaging server and of course the company of fun family! As per usual, we were so engaged in shenanigans of the night, we forgot to get selfie shots of ourselves, but just to put faces to our Pensacola hosts, we did manage to procure a picture of the elusive couple.</p>

<p>Our weekend in Pensacola also coincided with a downtown fair which we enjoyed perusing a few times on Saturday. After many nights apart from our boat buddies due to a few nights on anchor and different port stops, we decided to meet up for dinner at Jacos Bayside Bar &amp; Grill located right at our marina. The food was delicious and we had fun catching up on each others adventures.</p>
<p>Today we headed to Destin, FL as we try to time a window for crossing the Gulf from Carrabelle to Tarpon Springs.</p>
