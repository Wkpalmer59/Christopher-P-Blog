<p>On Sunday we traveled to Destin for a quick overnight as we continue to move towards Carabelle. We did catch a nice sunset at the Bluewater Bay Marina.</p>

<p>On Monday we did a rather long day to Panama City to a well protected marina where we are staying for two nights to wait out a cold front and the remnants of Sara.</p>
<p>On the way we traveled through a 15 mile man made canal, which was pretty boring, but we did run across an interesting sight.</p>

<p>We also came across two navy escort vessels that seemed to be protecting some kind of experimental vessel.</p>

<p>This morning we got laundry done before the heavy rains set in and then we hunkered down for the afternoon and evening.</p>
