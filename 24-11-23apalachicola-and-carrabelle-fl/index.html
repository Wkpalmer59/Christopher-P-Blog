<p>On Wednesday we did a fairly long day to Apalachicola for a quick overnight. The marina was behind a hotel and they were clearly not used to a lot of transients. The slip was barely wide enough for our boats and there was no one there to help us in. Our buddy boat had to squeeze in.</p>

<p>The good news is that the marina was close to town so we were able to take in some of the sights on our morning walk.</p>

<p>Thursday we did a short run to Carrabelle where we will wait for our weather window to cross the Gulf to Clearwater. This a good spot to get fuel and there is a grocery store a block away.</p>

<p>On Thursday night we went to dinner at a local bar that had a great band, so we ended up staying later than planned drinking and dancing the night away.</p>

<p>The weather is looking favorable for our offshore run so we will head out to an anchorage near the inlet today so we can get an early start tomorrow morning. We only have about 10.5 hours of daylight and we expect the trip to take 10 hours, so we will pull anchor before sunrise. By Sunday evening, we should be tied up in Clearwater, FL.</p>
