<h1>Clearwater, FL</h1>

<p>On Saturday we left the marina in Carrabelle and moved to an anchorage behind Dog Island to stage for an early departure for our Gulf crossing on Sunday. We had a peaceful night and were treated to a nice sunset.</p>

<p>We hauled anchor at 5:30am and traveled in the dark (not fun) out of the inlet and into the Gulf of Mexico. We watched the sunrise to an absolutely perfect day and set a course for Clearwater 144 nautical miles away.</p>

<p>We had some playful dolphins escort us along as they were jumping clear out of the water.</p>

<p>When we were about 20 miles out of Clearwater, we came across a capsized boat. It looked pretty recent and there was no one in sight in distress. We reported it to the Coast Guard and surprisingly they had a helicopter on sight within about 10 minutes. We heard several radio calls referencing it as we continued on giving us the impression they may have been looking for that particular boat.</p>

<p>We arrived in Clearwater around 4pm and were thankful for a mostly calm 11 hour run. It did get a bit sporty for about an hour or so due to shifting winds, but nothing worse then we’ve experienced before. All in all, the way the Gulf has been kicking up this November, we were thankful for a successful crossing!</p>
<p>It was late afternoon by the time we arrived in Clearwater. It was a bittersweet evening as we bid ado to our boat buddies, Dennis and Colleen on Seas The Moment. They have been a part of our daily adventures since April, experiencing the good times as well as bad, and always weathering it together, so while they will be missed, we are excited for whatever continued adventures we each will experience (and we plan to stay in touch🥰). Our main goal was to cross the Gulf together having each other boats (backs) and we were all very grateful for that.</p>

<p>Because our day was so long, we unfortunately did not get to explore this beautiful town of Clearwater as much as we would have liked (feeling a bit of crunch time with the holidays). However, our morning walk made us feel as though this is a spot we’d really enjoy revisiting!</p>

<p>Today we ran the waterway down to Sarasota.</p>
