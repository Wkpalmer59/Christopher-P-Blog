<p>We left Clearwater early yesterday morning and had a beautiful ride down to Sarasota. We pulled into the fuel dock at about 1:30 to get fuel at the marina we were staying at and found out that the majority of marinas around had hurricane damage to their fuel docks, so where we were was the only game in town. Unfortunately the pumps were painfully slow, so we were at the fuel dock until about 3:00. We took on about 288 gallons &amp; it took 1.5 hours; the boat waiting to come in as we left was anticipating taking on 1,200 gallons…no question he’d be there close to closing time! After showering &amp; chilling for a while, we decided to head out &amp; see the city. Apparently this downtown area has 39 bars &amp; restaurants &amp; we sure did pass many! After a few blocks, the Admiral spied an open corner of the bar through a window, so stopped in for a few beverages &amp; a bite to eat. A couple came in afterward with the same idea, so we gave up our coveted corner &amp; scootched down for them. As we started chatting with them, we found out they were there on vacation from New York!</p>

<p>This morning on our walk, we went a different route &amp; found a nice park. A part of it was closed because it was apparent they suffered a lot of hurricane damage.</p>
