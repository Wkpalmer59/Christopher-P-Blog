<p>We had a very nice run from Sarasota to Cape Coral. We were treated to another day of gorgeous weather and once again, the dolphins did not disappoint!</p>

<p>We arrived in Cape Coral about 3:30 where Alan met us in his pontoon boat and escorted us into the canal. We dropped anchor in the basin right outside their building. We launched the dinghy, tied up at their dock and went inside for a cocktail with Alan.</p>

<p>We then set out to go across the street to meet Betty at the very lively Moose Club. Betty was involved in a rousing game of “show me the money” so we ordered drinks and joined her. We must’ve brought her luck because she won around seventy bucks shortly after we came in!🍀 We then headed out to dinner to a local place they frequent called Pinchers.</p>

<p>After drinks and dinner, we headed back for an early night since our plan was to haul anchor at 6:15 because we coordinated going through 4 locks today with another looper we’ve been ‘leapfrogging’ with at times during our loop journey. (We actually took their boat picture under the St. Louis arch)!</p>
