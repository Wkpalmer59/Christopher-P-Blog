<p>We had an uneventful run from Cape Coral to Clewiston on yet another beautiful weather day. We went through four locks, the last lock being an unexpected one as it is just to get in and out of the marina but the water levels in the lake are higher due to all the latest storms. On top of that, we had a slight delay as we had to wait for a manatee that decided to lock through from the marina side.</p>

<p>These locks are different from the other ones we’ve been through in that they open the doors to let the water in as opposed to filling from underneath.</p>
<p>Today we cross Lake Okeechobee and complete our last two locks of this trip as we head to Stuart, FL to spend a few days with family. Happy Thanksgiving family &amp; friends!🧡🤎</p>
