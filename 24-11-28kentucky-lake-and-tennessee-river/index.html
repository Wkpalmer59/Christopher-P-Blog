<h1>Kentucky Lake and Tennessee River</h1>

<p>We left Green Turtle Bay on Saturday and headed down Kentucky Lake. We stopped at the Paris Landing State Park Marina Saturday night which had a large park with trails and an aviary where they were rehabbing a couple of owls and an Osprey.</p>

<p>Yesterday we continued down the lake and into the Tennessee River (the lake is really part of the river) and anchored in a quiet spot on Birdsong Creek.</p>

<p>The fall foliage has been very pretty, although the pictures don’t do it justice.</p>

<p>While we were sitting on anchor we watched some local duck hunters as they built a hunting blind by gathering branches from the shore until fully constructed, and then they towed it out into the wider part of the river. We assume they will be going after the migrating ducks.</p>

<p>We had planned to stay at a Marina in Clifton Tennessee tonight, but they didn’t have room for us, so we anchored a couple of miles further up river. Interesting fact is that we are actually traveling “up” the Tennessee River as it flows north through this part of Tennessee and into Kentucky where it dumps into the Ohio River.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will continue up the river to Pickwick Lake where it will turn into the Tenn-Tom waterway and pass into Mississippi, stopping in Luka, MS.</p>
