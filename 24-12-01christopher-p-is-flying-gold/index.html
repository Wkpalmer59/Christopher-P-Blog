<p>7 miles after we left Stuart this morning we officially “crossed our wake” as we passed buoy number 2 at the junction of the St. Lucie River and the Intracoastal Waterway. We passed this spot on March 25th which marked the beginning of our Great Loop trip.</p>

<p>Once we arrived in Vero Beach we took the obligatory pictures and then cracked a bottle of champagne; we did a toast to ourselves and this fine ship that carried us through this trip with very few issues.</p>

<p>Here are some interesting stats:</p>
<p>We started on March 25th and finished on December 1st, that is 252 days. During that time we traveled 5,800 statute miles (5,044 NM), visited 18 states and 2 countries, went through 108 locks, made 134 stops and traversed over 90 bodies of water (waterway canals, channels, rivers, lakes, sounds, bays, gulfs and oceans)</p>

<p>Today was a very windy day so we decided to stay here in Vero for another night with hope the wind will die down some. Tuesday we will continue on to our new winter home on Merritt Island where we will check out our new digs, enjoy anticipated get together with Clark &amp; Susan and prep the boat before we head home for Christmas.</p>
