<p>On Thanksgiving day we left Clewiston and had a beautiful ride across Lake Okeechobee. We traversed the last three locks of our Loop trip arriving in Stuart around 3pm. Don and Kim drove to the St. Lucie lock and documented us going though the last lock of our trip, which ended up being a total of 108 locks!</p>

<p>We were met at the dock in Stuart by our good friends we had stayed in touch with, T and Tosha, who were our boat neighbors when we were at Milford Boat Works in CT. They have been wintering here for a few years and invited us to join them for Thanksgiving dinner. We originally declined as we didn’t want to impose, but at their insistence we accepted their invite and we’re so glad we did! We had a great time catching up with them and it was an unanticipated surprise for us to have a traditional Thanksgiving meal while traveling on Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>Don &amp; Kim let us use one of their cars, so we spent Friday and Saturday morning getting errands and boat chores done. Friday afternoon we got to see their new home and enjoy some quality time together. Saturday morning we prepped for the last leg of our journey, had lunch with Don &amp; Kim, then dragged our recycles and laundry to their house.(Nothing says family like getting your laundry done while watching a Christmas movie!)🎄</p>

<p>Today is an exciting day for us as we travel the last 7 miles of our Great Loop trip, crossing our wake as we exit the St. Lucie River into the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.</p>
